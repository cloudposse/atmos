# Demo stack that imports from both local and remote sources.
#
# This demonstrates the remote stack imports feature:
# - Local imports work as before (catalog/base)
# - Remote imports are downloaded via go-getter and merged
#
# Note: The remote import URL points to a fixture file in the atmos repo.
# This example works once the remote-stack-imports feature is merged to main.

import:
  # Local import - provides base component configuration
  - catalog/base

  # Remote import - fetches shared configuration from GitHub
  # This URL points to the test fixture in the atmos repo
