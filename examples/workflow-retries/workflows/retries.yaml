    description: |
      Demonstrates automatic retry behavior when commands fail.
      The command intentionally fails to show retries in action.
    steps:
      - command: echo "Attempting deployment..." && exit 1
        type: shell
        retry:
          max_attempts: 3
          initial_delay: 100ms
          backoff_strategy: exponential
          multiplier: 2.0
