    # Source 'uri' supports the following protocols: Git, Mercurial, HTTP, HTTPS, Amazon S3, Google GCP,
    # and all URL and archive formats as described in https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter
    # In 'uri', Golang templates are supported  https://pkg.go.dev/text/template
    # If 'version' is provided, '{{.Version}}' will be replaced with the 'version' value before pulling the files from 'uri'

    version: 1.372.0
    # Only include the files that match the 'included_paths' patterns
    # If 'included_paths' is not specified, all files will be matched except those that match the patterns from 'excluded_paths'
    # 'included_paths' support POSIX-style Globs for file names/paths (double-star `**` is supported)
    # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)
    # https://github.com/bmatcuk/doublestar#patterns
    included_paths:
      - "**/*.tf"
      - "**/*.tfvars"

  # mixins override files from 'source' with the same 'filename' (e.g. 'context.tf' will override 'context.tf' from the 'source')
  # mixins are processed in the order they are declared in the list
  mixins:
    # https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter/issues/98
    # Mixins 'uri' supports the following protocols: local files (absolute and relative paths), Git, Mercurial, HTTP, HTTPS, Amazon S3, Google GCP
    # - uri: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label/0.25.0/exports/context.tf
    # This mixin `uri` is relative to the current `vpc` folder
    - uri: ../../mixins/context.tf
