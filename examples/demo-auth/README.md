# Demo: Auth

This demo showcases how to structure an Atmos project with an `auth` section in `atmos.yaml`. Please see [the Atmos docs](https://atmos.tools/cli/commands/auth/usage) for more information.

It intentionally only validates stack manifests (no Terraform applies) to avoid requiring real cloud credentials in CI.
