<Intro>
Atmos is a framework for defining cloud architectures in YAML. To understand what the fully-deep merged configuration will look like, you can describe it.
</Intro>

Configurations for all Components are defined in Stacks, which define the settings for small units infrastructure called Components like VPCs, Clusters, and Databases. Atmos lets you combine components into reusable, nestable Stacks using Imports. Everything from simple web sites to full blown multi-account/multi-subscription cloud architectures can be broken down into components. 

In this chapter, youâ€™ll learn to describe all aspects of the fully-deepmerged configurations so you can undersatnd what Atmos stacks look like.
