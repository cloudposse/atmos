<Intro>
Breaking apart your infrastructure into loosely-coupled components is a great way to manage complexity and reuse code. However, sometimes you need to share data between components. In Atmos, you can easily share settings, configuration, and outputs between components.

</Intro>

There are two ways to go about it. Use native terraform support for remote state, to read the outputs from other components, or using template functions in stack configurations.

- Why you might need to share data between components
- How to share data between components using Terraform remote state
- How to use template functions to share data between components in stack configurations
</KeyPoints>

## Using Remote State

<ActionCard>
Use how to use Terraform `remote-state` share data between components.

## Using Template Functions

```yaml
```

<ActionCard>
Use the `{{ atmos.Component("<something>") }}` template functions share data between components. The function allows reading any Atmos section or any attribute from a section of an Atmos component in a stack.
