<Intro>
Breaking up your infrastructure components into loosely coupled components is a great way to manage complexity and
reuse code. However, these smaller components often lead to a situation where you need to share data between components.
In Atmos, there are several ways you can easily share settings, configurations, and outputs among components and even
tap into external data sources and stores.
</Intro>

There are multiple ways to approach this: using native Terraform support for remote state to read outputs from other
components or using template functions in stack configurations. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to share state between
components within the same stack or even across different stacks.

## Using YAML Functions

###  Function: `!store`

The `!store` YAML function can read data from a remote store such as SSM Parameter Store, Artifactory, or Redis.

For example, we can read the `vpc_id` output of the `vpc` component in the current stack from the SSM Parameter Store
configured in `atmos.yaml` as `ssm/prod` simply by doing:

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    cluster:
      vars:
        vpc_id: !store ssm/prod vpc vpc_id
```

To access the configuration of a component in a different stack, you can specify the stack name as the second argument.
For example, here we're reading the `vpc_id` output of the `vpc` component in the `staging` stack:

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    cluster:
      vars:
        vpc_id: !store ssm/prod staging vpc vpc_id
```

###  Function: `!terraform.output`

The `!terraform.output` YAML function allows reading the outputs ([remote state](/core-concepts/share-data/remote-state))
of components directly in Atmos stack manifests by internally executing a
[`terraform output`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/output) or
[`tofu output`](https://opentofu.org/docs/cli/commands/output/) command.

For example, we can read the `vpc_id` output of the `vpc` component in the current stack:

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    cluster:
      vars:
        vpc_id: !terraform.output vpc vpc_id
```

To access the configuration of a component in a different stack, you can specify the stack name as the second argument.
For example, here we're reading the `vpc_id` output of the `vpc` component in the `prod` stack:

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    cluster:
      vars:
        vpc_id: !terraform.output vpc prod vpc_id
```

###  Function: `!terraform.state`

The [`!terraform.state`](/functions/yaml/terraform.state) YAML function reads outputs **directly from the configured Terraform or OpenTofu backend**, bypassing the `terraform output` or `tofu output` pipeline — it's **very fast**, doesn't require provider initialization, and currently supports [S3 and local backends](/core-concepts/components/terraform/backends#supported-terraform-backends) for accessing [remote state](/core-concepts/share-data/remote-state).

For example, we can read the `vpc_id` output of the `vpc` component in the current stack:

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    cluster:
      vars:
        vpc_id: !terraform.state vpc vpc_id
```

To access the configuration of a component in a different stack, you can specify the stack name as the second argument.
For example, here we're reading the `vpc_id` output of the `vpc` component in the `prod` stack:

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    cluster:
      vars:
        vpc_id: !terraform.state vpc prod vpc_id
```

:::tip
The [`!terraform.state`](/functions/yaml/terraform.state) function accepts the same parameters and
produces the same result as the [`!terraform.output`](/functions/yaml/terraform.output) function,
but has significantly less impact on performance as it reads the state file directly from the configured backend without
executing Terraform/OpenTofu commands, generating varfiles and backend config files, and initializing all modules and providers.

To understand the performance implications of the `!terraform.output` and `!terraform.state` functions,
compare the [!terraform.output Execution Flow](/functions/yaml/terraform.output#terraformoutput-function-execution-flow) with the
[!terraform.state Execution Flow](/functions/yaml/terraform.state#terraformstate-function-execution-flow).

## Using Template Functions

###  Function: `atmos.Store`

The `atmos.Store` template function can read data from a remote store such as SSM Parameter Store, Artifactory, or Redis.

For example, we can read the `vpc_id` output of the `vpc` component in the current stack from the SSM Parameter Store
configured in `atmos.yaml` as `ssm` simply by doing:

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    cluster:
      vars:
        vpc_id: '{{ atmos.Store "ssm" .stack "vpc" "vpc_id" }}'
```

To access the configuration of a component in a different stack, you can specify the stack name as the second argument.
For example, here we're reading the `vpc_id` output of the `vpc` component in the `staging` stack:

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    cluster:
      vars:
        vpc_id: '{{ atmos.Store "ssm" "staging" "vpc" "vpc_id" }}'
```

<ActionCard>
    For more advanced examples, check out the `atmos.Store` template function documentation.
    <PrimaryCTA to="/functions/template/atmos.Store">Learn More</PrimaryCTA>
</ActionCard>

###  Function: `atmos.Component`

The `atmos.Component` template function can read all configurations of any Atmos component, including its outputs.

For example, we can read the `vpc_id` output of the `vpc` component in the current `.stack`, simply by doing:

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    cluster:
      vars:
        vpc_id: '{{ (atmos.Component "vpc" .stack).outputs.vpc_id }}'
```

The `atmos.Component` function returns the entire configuration of the component in the stack. The configuration is a map of all the sections of the component, including its outputs. You can access properties using dot (`.`) notation, and chain any number of attributes with dot (`.`) notation.

To access the configuration of a component in a different stack, you can specify the stack name as the second argument. For example, here we're reading the `vpc_id` output of the `vpc` component in the `staging` stack:

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    cluster:
      vars:
        vpc_id: '{{ (atmos.Component "vpc" "staging").outputs.vpc_id }}'
```

### Data Sources

Data sources are incredibly powerful. They let you glue together components leveraging external data sources without modifying a line of Terraform code. This is great when you want to leave your Terraform codebase untouched, especially if you don't control the source.

Data sources allow you to fetch and use data from external sources in your stack configurations. You can use data sources to fetch data from APIs, various key/value storage systems, or even local files.

They can be fetched from any of the following schemes supported by Gomplate:

<CollapsibleText>
- **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store** (`aws+smp://`)
- **AWS Secrets Manager** (`aws+sm://`)
- **Amazon S3** (`s3://`)
- **HashiCorp Consul** (`consul://`, `consul+http://`, `consul+https://`)
- **Environment Variables** (`env://`)
- **Files** (`file://`)
- **Git Repositories** (`git://`, `git+file://`, `git+http://`, `git+https://`, `git+ssh://`)
- **Google Cloud Storage** (`gs://`)
- **HTTP/HTTPS Endpoints** (`http://`, `https://`)
- **Merging Data Sources** (`merge://`)
- **Standard Input** (`stdin://`)
- **HashiCorp Vault** (`vault://`, `vault+http://`, `vault+https://`)
</CollapsibleText>

:::tip On-the-Fly Root Modules

When you combine data sources with [vendoring](/core-concepts/vendor), [terraform backends](/core-concepts/components/terraform/backends#supported-terraform-backends) and [provider](/core-concepts/components/terraform/providers#dynamic-provider-configuration) generation, you can leverage any Terraform module as a "root module" and provision it as a component with Atmos.
:::

Configure your data sources in `atmos.yaml`, then leverage them inside stack configurations.

Here we set up a data source called `ip`, which will fetch the public IP address by hitting the
`https://api.ipify.org?format=json` endpoint.

<File title="atmos.yaml">
```yaml
settings:
  templates:
    settings:
      gomplate:
        timeout: 5
        datasources:
          network_egress:
            url: "https://api.ipify.org?format=json"
            headers:
              accept:
                - "application/json"
```
</File>

Then, you can use the `network_egress` data source in your stack configurations to fetch the public `ip`. This is useful for setting a tag indicating the IP address that provisioned the resources.

<Note>This assumes the Terraform component accepts a `tags` variable and appropriately handles tags.</Note>
<File title="stack.yaml">
```yaml
terraform:
  vars:
    tags:
      provisioned_by_ip: '{{ (datasource "ip").ip }}'
```
</File>

## Using Terraform Remote State

Atmos provides a [`remote-state`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-yaml-stack-config/tree/main/modules/remote-state) Terraform module that makes it easier to look up the remote state of other components in the stack. This module can be used to share data between components provisioned in the same stack or across different stacks, using native HCL.

Our convention is to place all remote-state dependencies in the `remote-state.tf` file. This file is responsible for fetching the remote state outputs of other components in the stack.

<File title="components/terraform/myapp/remote-state.tf">
```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source  = "cloudposse/stack-config/yaml//modules/remote-state"
  version = "1.5.0"

  # Specify the Atmos component name (defined in YAML stack config files) for which to get the remote state outputs
  component = "vpc"

  # `context` input is a way to provide the information about the stack (using the context
  # variables `namespace`, `tenant`, `environment`, `stage` defined in the stack config)
  context = module.this.context
}
```
</File>

Then we can use the `module.vpc` as easily as if it were provisioned within the `myapp` component.

This gives us the best of both worlds: the ease of use of Terraform remote state and the reduced blast radius of using smaller components.

<File title="components/terraform/myapp/main.tf">
```hcl
resource "aws_network_acl" "default" {

  vpc_id = module.vpc.vpc_id

  ingress {
    protocol   = "tcp"
    rule_no    = 100
    action     = "allow"
    cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
    from_port  = 80
    to_port    = 80
  }
}
```
