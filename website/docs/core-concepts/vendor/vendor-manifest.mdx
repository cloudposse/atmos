<Intro>
The vendoring configuration is defined in the `vendor.yaml` manifest (vendor config file). The vendoring manifest is used to make copies of 3rd-party components, stacks, and other artifacts in your own repository.
</Intro>

It functions a little bit like the `packages.json` file in Node.js or the `go.mod` file in Go, but for infrastructure code.

## How it works

Atmos searches for the vendoring manifest in the following locations and uses the first one found:

- In the directory from which the [`atmos vendor pull`](/cli/commands/vendor/pull) command is executed, usually in the root of the infrastructure repo

- In the directory pointed to by the [`base_path`](/cli/configuration/#base-path) setting in the [`atmos.yaml`](/cli/configuration) CLI config file

After defining the `vendor.yaml` manifest, all the remote artifacts can be downloaded by running the following command:

```shell
atmos vendor pull
```

To vendor a particular component or other artifact, execute the following command:

```shell
atmos vendor pull -c <component>
```

To vendor components and artifacts tagged with specific tags, execute the following command:

```shell
atmos vendor pull --tags <tag1>,<tag2>
```

## Vendoring Manifest

To vendor remote artifacts, create a `vendor.yaml` file similar to the example below:

<File title="vendor.yaml">
```yaml
apiVersion: atmos/v1
kind: AtmosVendorConfig
metadata:
  name: example-vendor-config
  description: Atmos vendoring manifest
spec:
  # `imports` or `sources` (or both) must be defined in a vendoring manifest
  imports:
    - "vendor/vendor2"
    - "vendor/vendor3.yaml"

  sources:
    # `source` supports the following protocols: local paths (absolute and relative), OCI (https://opencontainers.org),
    # Git, Mercurial, HTTP, HTTPS, Amazon S3, Google GCP,
    # and all URL and archive formats as described in https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter.
    # In 'source', Golang templates are supported  https://pkg.go.dev/text/template.
    # If 'version' is provided, '{{.Version}}' will be replaced with the 'version' value before pulling the files from 'source'.
    # Download the component from the AWS public ECR registry (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/public/public-registries.html).
    - component: "vpc"
      source: "oci://public.ecr.aws/cloudposse/components/terraform/stable/aws/vpc:{{.Version}}"
      version: "latest"
      targets:
        - "components/terraform/infra/vpc3"
      # Only include the files that match the 'included_paths' patterns.
      # If 'included_paths' is not specified, all files will be matched except those that match the patterns from 'excluded_paths'.
      # 'included_paths' support POSIX-style Globs for file names/paths (double-star `**` is supported).
      # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)
      # https://github.com/bmatcuk/doublestar#patterns
      included_paths:
        - "**/*.tf"
        - "**/*.tfvars"
        - "**/*.md"
      # Tags can be used to vendor component that have the specific tags
      # `atmos vendor pull --tags test`
      # Refer to https://atmos.tools/cli/commands/vendor/pull
      tags:
        - test
        - networking
    - component: "vpc-flow-logs-bucket"
      source: "github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components.git//modules/vpc-flow-logs-bucket?ref={{.Version}}"
      version: "1.323.0"
      targets:

      excluded_paths:

        - "**/*.yml"
      # Tags can be used to vendor component that have the specific tags
      # `atmos vendor pull --tags networking,storage`
      # Refer to https://atmos.tools/cli/commands/vendor/pull
      tags:
        - test
        - storage
    - component: "vpc-mixin-1"
      source: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label/0.25.0/exports/context.tf"
      targets:
        - "components/terraform/infra/vpc3"
      # Tags can be used to vendor component that have the specific tags
      # `atmos vendor pull --tags test`
      # Refer to https://atmos.tools/cli/commands/vendor/pull
      tags:
        - test
    - component: "vpc-mixin-2"
      # Copy a local file into a local folder (keeping the same file name)
      # This `source` is relative to the current folder
      source: "components/terraform/mixins/context.tf"
      targets:
        - "components/terraform/infra/vpc3"
      # Tags can be used to vendor component that have the specific tags
      # `atmos vendor pull --tags test`
      # Refer to https://atmos.tools/cli/commands/vendor/pull
      tags:
        - test
    - component: "vpc-mixin-3"
      # Copy a local folder into a local folder
      # This `source` is relative to the current folder
      source: "components/terraform/mixins"
      targets:
        - "components/terraform/infra/vpc3"
      # Tags can be used to vendor component that have the specific tags
      # `atmos vendor pull --tags test`
      # Refer to https://atmos.tools/cli/commands/vendor/pull
      tags:
        - test
    - component: "vpc-mixin-4"
      # Copy a local file into a local file with a different file name
      # This `source` is relative to the current folder
      source: "components/terraform/mixins/context.tf"
      targets:
        - "components/terraform/infra/vpc3/context-copy.tf"
      # Tags can be used to vendor component that have the specific tags
      # `atmos vendor pull --tags test`
      # Refer to https://atmos.tools/cli/commands/vendor/pull
      tags:
        - test
```
</File>

With this configuration, it would be possible to run the following commands:
<Terminal>
```shell
# atmos vendor pull
# atmos vendor pull --component vpc-mixin-1
# atmos vendor pull -c vpc-mixin-2
# atmos vendor pull -c vpc-mixin-3
# atmos vendor pull -c vpc-mixin-4
# atmos vendor pull --tags test
# atmos vendor pull --tags networking,storage
```
</Terminal>

The `vendor.yaml` vendoring manifest supports Kubernetes-style YAML config to describe vendoring configuration for components, stacks,
  and other artifacts. The file is placed into the directory from which the `atmos vendor pull` command is executed (usually the root of the repo).

<dl>

  <dt>`source`</dt>
  <dd>
    The `source` attribute supports all protocols (local files, Git, Mercurial, HTTP, HTTPS, Amazon S3, Google GCP), and all the URL and
    archive formats as described in [go-getter](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter), and also the `oci://` scheme to download artifacts from [OCI registries](https://opencontainers.org).

    **IMPORTANT:** Include the `{{ .Version }}` parameter in your `source` URI to ensure the correct version of the artifact is downloaded.
    For example:

    ```yaml
    source: "github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components.git//modules/vpc-flow-logs-bucket?ref={{.Version}}"
    ```
  </dd>

  <dt>`targets`</dt>
  <dd>
  The `targets` in each source supports absolute paths and relative paths (relative to the `vendor.yaml` file). Note: if the `targets` paths
    are set as relative, and if the `vendor.yaml` file is detected by Atmos using the `base_path` setting in `atmos.yaml`, the `targets` paths
    will be considered relative to the `base_path`. Multiple targets can be specified.
  </dd>

  <dt>`included_paths` and `excluded_paths`</dt>
  <dd>
  `included_paths` and `excluded_paths` support [POSIX-style greedy Globs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) for filenames/paths (double-star/globstar `**` is supported as well).
  </dd>

  <dt>`component`</dt>
  <dd>
  The `component` attribute in each source is optional. It's used in the `atmos vendor pull -- component <component>` command if the component is passed in. In this case, Atmos will vendor only the specified component instead of vendoring all the artifacts configured in the `vendor.yaml` manifest.
  </dd>

  <dt>`source` and `targets` templates</dt>
  <dd>
  The `source` and `targets` attributes support [Go templates](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) and [Sprig Functions](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/). This can be used to templatise the `source` and `targets` paths with the artifact versions specified in the `version` attribute.

    Here's an advanced example showcasing how templates and Sprig functions can be used together with `targets`:

    ```yaml
    targets:
      # Vendor a component into a major-minor versioned folder like 1.2
      - "components/terraform/infra/vpc-flow-logs-bucket/{{ (first 2 (splitList \".\" .Version)) | join \".\" }}"
    ```
  </dd>

  <dt>`tags`</dt>
  <dd>
  The `tags` in each source specifies a list of tags to apply to the component. This allows you to only vendor the components that have the specified tags by executing a command `atmos vendor pull --tags <tag1>,<tag2>`
  </dd>

  <dt>`imports`</dt>
  <dd>
  The `imports` section defines the additional vendoring manifests that are merged into the main manifest. Hierarchical imports are supported at many levels (one vendoring manifest can import another, which in turn can import other manifests, etc.). Atmos processes all imports and all sources in the imported manifests in the order they are defined.

  :::note
  The imported file extensions are optional. If an import is defined without an extension, the `.yaml` extension is assumed and used by default.
  :::

  <File title="vendor.yaml">
  ```yaml title="vendor.yaml"
  spec:
    sources:
      - component: "vpc-flow-logs-bucket"
        source: "github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components.git//modules/vpc-flow-logs-bucket?ref={{.Version}}"
        version: "1.323.0"
        targets:
          - "components/terraform/vpc-flow-logs-bucket"
        included_paths:
          - "**/**"
          # If the component's folder has the `modules` sub-folder, it needs to be explicitly defined
          - "**/modules/**"
  ```
  </File>

  :::warning

  The `glob` library that Atmos uses to download remote artifacts does not treat the double-star `**` as including sub-folders.
  If the component's folder has sub-folders, and you need to vendor them, they have to be explicitly defined as in the following example.

## Hierarchical Imports in Vendoring Manifests

Use `imports` to split the main `vendor.yaml` manifest into smaller files for maintainability, or by their roles in the infrastructure.

For example, import separate manifests for networking, security, data management, CI/CD, and other layers:

```yaml
imports:
  - "layers/networking"
  - "layers/security"
  - "layers/data"
  - "layers/analytics"
  - "layers/firewalls"
  - "layers/cicd"
```

Hierarchical imports are supported at many levels. For example, consider the following vendoring configurations:

<File title="vendor.yaml">
```yaml
apiVersion: atmos/v1
kind: AtmosVendorConfig
metadata:
  name: example-vendor-config
  description: Atmos vendoring manifest
spec:
  imports:
    - "vendor/vendor2"
    - "vendor/vendor3"

  sources:
    - component: "vpc"
      source: "oci://public.ecr.aws/cloudposse/components/terraform/stable/aws/vpc:{{.Version}}"
      version: "latest"
      targets:
        - "components/terraform/infra/vpc3"
    - component: "vpc-flow-logs-bucket"
      source: "github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components.git//modules/vpc-flow-logs-bucket?ref={{.Version}}"
      version: "1.323.0"
      targets:
        - "components/terraform/infra/vpc-flow-logs-bucket/{{.Version}}"
```
</File>


<File title="vendor/vendor2.yaml">
```yaml
apiVersion: atmos/v1
kind: AtmosVendorConfig
metadata:
  name: example-vendor-config-2
  description: Atmos vendoring manifest
spec:
  imports:
    - "vendor/vendor4"

  sources:
    - component: "my-vpc1"
      source: "oci://public.ecr.aws/cloudposse/components/terraform/stable/aws/vpc:{{.Version}}"
      version: "1.0.2"
      targets:
        - "components/terraform/infra/my-vpc1"
```
</File>

<File title="vendor/vendor4.yaml">
```yaml
apiVersion: atmos/v1
kind: AtmosVendorConfig
metadata:
  name: example-vendor-config-4
  description: Atmos vendoring manifest
spec:
  imports:
    - "vendor/vendor5"

  sources:
    - component: "my-vpc4"
      source: "github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components.git//modules/vpc?ref={{.Version}}"
      version: "1.319.0"
      targets:
        - "components/terraform/infra/my-vpc4"
```
</File>

When you execute the `atmos vendor pull` command, Atmos processes the import chain and the sources in the imported manifests in the order they
are defined:

- First, the main `vendor.yaml` file is read based on search paths
- The `vendor/vendor2` and `vendor/vendor3` manifests (defined in the main `vendor.yaml` file) are imported
- The `vendor/vendor2` file is processed, and the `vendor/vendor4` manifest is imported
- The `vendor/vendor4` file is processed, and the `vendor/vendor5` manifest is imported
- Etc.
- Then all the sources from all the imported manifests are processed and the artifacts are downloaded into the paths defined by the `targets`

```shell
> atmos vendor pull

## Vendoring from OCI Registries

Atmos supports vendoring from [OCI registries](https://opencontainers.org).

To specify a repository in an OCI registry, use the `oci://<registry>/<repository>:tag` scheme.

Artifacts from OCI repositories are downloaded as Docker image tarballs, then all the layers are processed, un-tarred and un-compressed,
and the files are written into the directories specified by the `targets` attribute of each `source`.

For example, to vendor the `vpc` component from the `public.ecr.aws/cloudposse/components/terraform/stable/aws/vpc`
[AWS public ECR registry](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/public/public-registries.html), use the following `source`:

```yaml
source: "oci://public.ecr.aws/cloudposse/components/terraform/stable/aws/vpc:latest"
```

The schema of a `vendor.yaml` manifest is as follows:

<File title="vendor.yaml">
```yaml
# This is an example of how to download a Terraform component from an OCI registry (https://opencontainers.org), e.g. AWS Public ECR

apiVersion: atmos/v1
kind: AtmosVendorConfig
metadata:
  name: example-vendor-config
  description: Atmos vendoring manifest
spec:
  sources:
    - component: "vpc"
      source: "oci://public.ecr.aws/cloudposse/components/terraform/stable/aws/vpc:{{.Version}}"
      version: "latest"
      targets:
        - "components/terraform/infra/vpc3"
      included_paths:
        - "**/*.tf"
        - "**/*.tfvars"
        - "**/*.md"
      excluded_paths: []
```
</File>

To vendor the `vpc` component, execute the following command:

<Terminal>
```bash
atmos vendor pull -c vpc
```
</Terminal>
