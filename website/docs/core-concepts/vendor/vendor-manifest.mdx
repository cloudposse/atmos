<Intro>
The vendoring configuration is defined in the `vendor.yaml` manifest (vendor config file). The vendoring manifest is used to make copies of 3rd-party components, stacks, and other artifacts in your own repository.
</Intro>

It functions a little bit like the `packages.json` file in Node.js or the `go.mod` file in Go, but for infrastructure code.

## How it works

Atmos searches for the vendoring manifest in the following locations and uses the first one found:

- In the directory from which the [`atmos vendor pull`](/cli/commands/vendor/pull) command is executed, usually in the root of the infrastructure repo

- In the directory pointed to by the [`base_path`](/cli/configuration/#base-path) setting in the [`atmos.yaml`](/cli/configuration) CLI config file

After defining the `vendor.yaml` manifest, all the remote artifacts can be downloaded by running the following command:

```shell
atmos vendor pull
```

To vendor a particular component or other artifact, execute the following command:

```shell
atmos vendor pull -c <component>
```

To vendor components and artifacts tagged with specific tags, execute the following command:

```shell
atmos vendor pull --tags <tag1>,<tag2>
```

## Vendoring Manifest

To vendor remote artifacts, create a `vendor.yaml` file similar to the example below:

<CollapsibleText type="tall">
  <File title="vendor.yaml">
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: atmos/v1
  kind: AtmosVendorConfig

# atmos vendor pull --tags test
# atmos vendor pull --tags networking,storage
```
</Terminal>

## Vendoring Manifest Schema

The `vendor.yaml` vendoring manifest supports Kubernetes-style YAML config to describe vendoring configuration for components, stacks,
  and other artifacts. The file is placed into the directory from which the `atmos vendor pull` command is executed (usually the root of the repo).

<dl>
  <dt>`version`</dt>
  <dd>
    The `version` attribute is used to specify the version of the artifact to download. The `version` attribute is used in the `source` and `targets` attributes as a template parameter using `{{ .Version }}`.
  </dd>

  <dt>`source`</dt>
  <dd>
    The `source` attribute supports all protocols (local files, Git, Mercurial, HTTP, HTTPS, Amazon S3, Google GCP), and all the URL and archive formats as described in [go-getter](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter), and also the `oci://` scheme to download artifacts from [OCI registries](https://opencontainers.org).

    See [Vendor URL Syntax](/core-concepts/vendor/url-syntax) for complete documentation on supported URL formats, authentication, and subdirectory syntax.

    **IMPORTANT:** Include the `{{ .Version }}` parameter in your `source` URI to ensure the correct version of the artifact is downloaded.

    For example, for `http` and `https` sources, use the following format:

    ```yaml
    source: "github.com/cloudposse-terraform-components/aws-vpc-flow-logs-bucket.git?ref={{.Version}}"
    ```

    For private Git repositories, prepend the URI with `git::` and use the following format to pass a environment variable with the GitHub token:

    ```yaml
    source: "git::https://{{env "GITHUB_TOKEN"}}@github.com/some-org/some-private-repo/terraform/vpc.git?ref={{.Version}}"
    ```
    Note, that `GITHUB_TOKEN` provided by GitHub Actions are only valid for the current repository, or repositories marked as `internal` within GitHub Enterprise organizations. For cross-repository access, make sure you provision a [fine grained token](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/authentication/permissions-required-for-fine-grained-personal-access-tokens?apiVersion=2022-11-28) with the necessary permissions.

    <dl>
      <dt>`ref`</dt>
      <dd>
        Pass the `ref` as a query string with either the tag, branch, or commit hash to download the correct version of the artifact. e.g. `?ref={{.Version}}` will pass the `version` attribute to the `ref` query string.
      </dd>
      <dt>`depth`</dt>
      <dd>
        Pass the `depth` as a query string to download only the specified number of commits from the repository. e.g. `?depth=1` will download only the latest commit.
      </dd>
    </dl>

  </dd>

  <dt>`targets`</dt>
  <dd>
  The `targets` in each source supports absolute paths and relative paths (relative to the `vendor.yaml` file). Note: if the `targets` paths
    are set as relative, and if the `vendor.yaml` file is detected by Atmos using the `base_path` setting in `atmos.yaml`, the `targets` paths
    will be considered relative to the `base_path`. Multiple targets can be specified.
  </dd>

  <dt>`included_paths` and `excluded_paths`</dt>
  <dd>
  `included_paths` and `excluded_paths` support [POSIX-style greedy Globs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) for filenames/paths (double-star/globstar `**` is supported as well). For more details, see [Vendoring with Globs](#vendoring-with-globs).
  </dd>

  <dt>`component`</dt>
  <dd>
  The `component` attribute in each source is optional. It's used in the `atmos vendor pull -- component <component>` command if the component is passed in. In this case, Atmos will vendor only the specified component instead of vendoring all the artifacts configured in the `vendor.yaml` manifest.
  </dd>

  <dt>`source` and `targets` templates</dt>
  <dd>
  The `source` and `targets` attributes support [Go templates](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) and [Sprig Functions](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/). This can be used to templatise the `source` and `targets` paths with the component name specified in the `component` attribute and artifact versions specified in the `version` attribute.

    Here's an advanced example showcasing how templates and Sprig functions can be used together with `targets`:

    ```yaml
    targets:
      # Vendor a component into a major-minor versioned folder like 1.2
      - "components/terraform/infra/vpc-flow-logs-bucket/{{ (first 2 (splitList \".\" .Version)) | join \".\" }}"
    ```
  </dd>

  <dt>`tags`</dt>
  <dd>
  The `tags` in each source specifies a list of tags to apply to the component. This allows you to only vendor the components that have the specified tags by executing a command `atmos vendor pull --tags <tag1>,<tag2>`
  </dd>

  <dt>`imports`</dt>
  <dd>
  The `imports` section defines the additional vendoring manifests that are merged into the main manifest. Hierarchical imports are supported at many levels (one vendoring manifest can import another, which in turn can import other manifests, etc.). Atmos processes all imports and all sources in the imported manifests in the order they are defined.

  :::note
  The imported file extensions are optional. Imports that do not include file extensions will default to the `.yaml` extension.
  :::

  <File title="vendor.yaml">
  ```yaml title="vendor.yaml"
  spec:
    sources:
      - component: "vpc-flow-logs-bucket"
        source: "github.com/cloudposse-terraform-components/aws-vpc-flow-logs-bucket.git?ref={{.Version}}"
        version: "1.323.0"
        targets:
          - "components/terraform/vpc-flow-logs-bucket"
        included_paths:
          - "**/**"
          # If the component's folder has the `modules` sub-folder, it needs to be explicitly defined
          - "**/modules/**"
  ```
  </File>

  :::warning

  The `glob` library that Atmos uses to download remote artifacts does not treat the double-star `**` as including sub-folders.
  If the component's folder has sub-folders, and you need to vendor them, they have to be explicitly defined as in the following example.

  :::
  </dd>
</dl>

## Template Parameters

The vendor manifest supports basic template parameters, which is useful for versioning and other dynamic values. The following template parameters are supported:

<dl>
  <dt>`{{ .Component }}`</dt>
  <dd>
    Refers to the `component` attribute in the current section. The `component` attribute is used to specify the component name. This is useful to vendor components into folders by the same name.
    ```yaml
    targets:
      - "components/terraform/{{ .Component }}"
    ```
  </dd>
  <dt>`{{ .Version }}`</dt>
  <dd>
    Refers to the `version` attribute the current section. The `version` attribute is used to specify the version of the artifact to download. This is useful to version components into different folders.
    ```yaml
    targets:
      - "components/terraform/{{ .Component }}/{{ .Version }}"
    ```
     When stacks need to pin to different versions of the same component, the `{{ .Version }}` template parameter can be used to ensure the components are vendored into different folders.
  </dd>
</dl>

You can also use any of the [hundreds of go-template functions](/functions/template). For example, to extract the major and minor version from the `{{ .Version }}` attribute, use the following template:

```yaml
targets:
  - "components/terraform/{{ .Component }}/{{ (first 2 (splitList \".\" .Version)) | join \".\" }}"
```

Or to access an environment variable in the `source` attribute, use the following template:

```yaml
source: "git::https://{{env "GITHUB_TOKEN"}}@github.com/some-org/some-private-repo/terraform/{{ .Component }}/{{ .Version }}.git?ref={{.Version}}"
```
This will enable vendoring to download the component into a versioned folder from a private repository, by reading the GitHub token from the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.


## Hierarchical Imports in Vendoring Manifests

Use `imports` to split the main `vendor.yaml` manifest into smaller files for maintainability, or by their roles in the infrastructure.

For example, import separate manifests for networking, security, data management, CI/CD, and other layers:

```yaml
imports:
  - "layers/networking"
  - "layers/security"
  - "layers/data"
  - "layers/analytics"
  - "layers/firewalls"
  - "layers/cicd"
```

Hierarchical imports are supported at many levels. For example, consider the following vendoring configurations:

<File title="vendor.yaml">
```yaml
apiVersion: atmos/v1
kind: AtmosVendorConfig
metadata:
  name: example-vendor-config
  description: Atmos vendoring manifest
spec:
  imports:
    - "vendor/vendor2"
    - "vendor/vendor3"

  sources:
    - component: "vpc"
      source: "oci://public.ecr.aws/cloudposse/components/terraform/stable/aws/vpc:{{.Version}}"
      version: "latest"
      targets:
        - "components/terraform/infra/vpc3"
    - component: "vpc-flow-logs-bucket"
      source: "github.com/cloudposse-terraform-components/aws-vpc-flow-logs-bucket.git?ref={{.Version}}"
      version: "1.323.0"
      targets:
        - "components/terraform/infra/vpc-flow-logs-bucket/{{.Version}}"
```
</File>


<File title="vendor/vendor2.yaml">
```yaml
apiVersion: atmos/v1
kind: AtmosVendorConfig
metadata:
  name: example-vendor-config-2
  description: Atmos vendoring manifest
spec:
  imports:
    - "vendor/vendor4"

  sources:
    - component: "my-vpc1"
      source: "oci://public.ecr.aws/cloudposse/components/terraform/stable/aws/vpc:{{.Version}}"
      version: "1.0.2"
      targets:
        - "components/terraform/infra/my-vpc1"
```
</File>

<File title="vendor/vendor4.yaml">
```yaml
apiVersion: atmos/v1
kind: AtmosVendorConfig
metadata:
  name: example-vendor-config-4
  description: Atmos vendoring manifest
spec:
  imports:
    - "vendor/vendor5"

  sources:
    - component: "my-vpc4"
      source: "github.com/cloudposse-terraform-components/aws-vpc.git?ref={{.Version}}"
      version: "1.319.0"
      targets:
        - "components/terraform/infra/my-vpc4"
```
</File>

When you execute the `atmos vendor pull` command, Atmos processes the import chain and the sources in the imported manifests in the order they
are defined:

- First, the main `vendor.yaml` file is read based on search paths
- The `vendor/vendor2` and `vendor/vendor3` manifests (defined in the main `vendor.yaml` file) are imported
- The `vendor/vendor2` file is processed, and the `vendor/vendor4` manifest is imported
- The `vendor/vendor4` file is processed, and the `vendor/vendor5` manifest is imported
- Etc.
- Then all the sources from all the imported manifests are processed and the artifacts are downloaded into the paths defined by the `targets`

<Terminal>
```shell
> atmos vendor pull

```
</Terminal>

## Vendoring Multiple Versions of Components

Atmos supports vendoring multiple versions of the same component. This is useful when you need to pin stacks to different versions of the same component.

When vendoring multiple versions of the same component, use the `{{ .Version }}` template parameter in the `targets` attribute to ensure the components are vendored into different folders. Then update the stack configuration to point to the correct version of the component, and ensure the `backend.s3.workspace_key_prefix` is defined _without the version_ to ensure you can seamlessly upgrade between versions of a component without losing the state. By default the `workspace_key_prefix` incorporates the `component` relative path, which will include the version if it's included in the path.

```
components:
  terraform:
    # `vpc` is the Atmos component name
    vpc:
      # Backend configuration for the component
      backend:
        s3:
          # Ensure the path in the bucket is stable across versions
          # IMPORTANT: If not explicitly set, the `workspace_key_prefix` will include the version
          #            This will cause the state to be lost when upgrading between versions.
          workspace_key_prefix: vpc
      metadata:
        # Point to the Terraform component on the filesystem
        component: vpc/1.2.3
```

:::important
If not using the S3 backend, use the appropriate parameter for your backend to ensure the workspace is stable across versions of the component deployed.
:::

## Vendoring from OCI Registries

Atmos supports vendoring from [OCI registries](https://opencontainers.org).

To specify a repository in an OCI registry, use the `oci://<registry>/<repository>:tag` scheme.

Artifacts from OCI repositories are downloaded as Docker image tarballs, then all the layers are processed, un-tarred and un-compressed,
and the files are written into the directories specified by the `targets` attribute of each `source`.

For example, to vendor the `vpc` component from the `public.ecr.aws/cloudposse/components/terraform/stable/aws/vpc`
[AWS public ECR registry](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/public/public-registries.html), use the following `source`:


<File title="vendor.yaml">
```yaml
# This is an example of how to download a Terraform component from an OCI registry (https://opencontainers.org), e.g. AWS Public ECR

apiVersion: atmos/v1
kind: AtmosVendorConfig
metadata:
  name: example-vendor-config
  description: Atmos vendoring manifest
spec:
  sources:
    - component: "vpc"
      source: "oci://public.ecr.aws/cloudposse/components/terraform/stable/aws/{{ .Component }}:{{ .Version }}"
      version: "latest"
      targets:
        - "components/terraform/{{ .Component }}"
      included_paths:
        - "**/*.tf"
        - "**/*.tfvars"
        - "**/*.md"
      excluded_paths: []
```
</File>


To vendor the `vpc` component, execute the following command:

<Terminal>
```bash
atmos vendor pull -c vpc
```
</Terminal>

## Vendoring with Globs

In Atmos, **glob patterns** define which files and directories are included or excluded during vendoring. These patterns go beyond simple wildcard characters like `*`—they follow specific rules that dictate how paths are matched. Understanding the difference between **greedy** (`**`) and **non-greedy** (`*`) patterns, along with other advanced glob syntax, ensures precise control over vendoring behavior.

### Understanding Wildcards, Ranges, and Recursion

Glob patterns in Atmos provide flexible and powerful matching, that's simpler to understand than regular expressions:

<dl>
  <dt>`*` (single asterisk)</dt>
  <dd>Matches any sequence of characters <strong>within a single path segment</strong>.</dd>
  <dd>Example: `vendor/*.yaml` matches `vendor/config.yaml` but <strong>not</strong> `vendor/subdir/config.yaml`.</dd>

  <dt>`**` (double asterisk, also known as a "greedy glob")</dt>
  <dd>Matches across <strong>multiple path segments recursively</strong>.</dd>
  <dd>Example: `vendor/**/*.yaml` matches `vendor/config.yaml`, `vendor/subdir/config.yaml`, and `vendor/deep/nested/config.yaml`.</dd>

  <dt>`?` (question mark)</dt>
  <dd>Matches <strong>exactly one character</strong> in a path segment.</dd>
  <dd>Example: `file?.txt` matches `file1.txt` and `fileA.txt` but <strong>not</strong> `file10.txt`.</dd>

  <dt>`[abc]` (character class)</dt>
  <dd>Matches <strong>any single character</strong> inside the brackets.</dd>
  <dd>Example: `file[123].txt` matches `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, and `file3.txt`, but <strong>not</strong> `file4.txt` or `file12.txt`.</dd>

  <dt>`[a-z]` (character range)</dt>
  <dd>Matches <strong>any single character</strong> within the specified range.</dd>
  <dd>Example: `file[a-c].txt` matches `filea.txt`, `fileb.txt`, and `filec.txt`.</dd>

  <dt>`{a,b,c}` (brace expansion)</dt>
  <dd>Matches <strong>any of the comma-separated patterns</strong>.</dd>
  <dd>Example: `*.{jpg,png,gif}` matches `image.jpg`, `image.png`, and `image.gif`.</dd>
</dl>

This distinction is important when excluding specific directories or files while vendoring.

#### Example: Excluding a Subdirectory

Consider the following configuration:

```yaml
included_paths:
  - "**/demo-library/**"
excluded_paths:
  - "**/demo-library/**/stargazers/**"
```

How it works:
- The `included_paths` rule `**/demo-library/**` ensures all files inside `demo-library` (at any depth) are vendored.
- The `excluded_paths` rule `**/demo-library/**/stargazers/**` prevents any files inside `stargazers` subdirectories from being vendored.

This means:
- All files within `demo-library` except those inside any `stargazers` subdirectory are vendored.
- Any other files outside `stargazers` are unaffected by this exclusion.

#### Example: A Non-Recursive Pattern That Doesn't Work

```yaml
included_paths:
  - "**/demo-library/*"
excluded_paths:
  - "**/demo-library/**/stargazers/**"
```

In this case:
- `**/demo-library/*` only matches immediate children of `demo-library`, not nested files or subdirectories.
- This means `stargazers/` itself could be matched, but its contents might not be explicitly excluded.
- To correctly capture all subdirectories and files while still excluding stargazers, use `**/demo-library/**/*`.

Using `{...}` for Multiple Extensions or Patterns

Curly braces `{...}` allow for expanding multiple patterns into separate glob matches. This is useful when selecting multiple file types or directories within a single glob pattern.

#### Example: Matching Multiple File Extensions

```yaml
included_paths:
  - "**/demo-library/**/*.{tf,md}"
```

This is equivalent to writing:

```yaml
included_paths:
  - "**/demo-library/**/*.tf"
  - "**/demo-library/**/*.md"
```

The `{tf,md}` part expands to both `*.tf` and `*.md`, making the rule more concise.

#### Example: Excluding Multiple Directories

```yaml
excluded_paths:
  - "**/demo-library/**/{stargazers,archive}/**"
```

This excludes both:
- `**/demo-library/**/stargazers/**`
- `**/demo-library/**/archive/**`

Using `{...}` here prevents the need to write two separate exclusion rules.

## Key Takeaways

1. Use `**/` for recursive matching to include everything inside a directory.
2. Use `*` for single-segment matches, which won't include deeper subdirectories.
3. Use `{...}` to match multiple extensions or directories within a single pattern.
4. Exclusion rules must match nested paths explicitly when trying to exclude deep directories.

By carefully combining `included_paths`, `excluded_paths`, and `{...}` expansion, you can precisely control which files are vendored while ensuring unwanted directories are omitted.
