<Intro>
Atmos natively supports the concept of "vendoring" individual components by defining a `component.yaml` inside of the component directory, which is making a copy of 3rd-party components or other dependencies in your own repo.
</Intro>

## Examples

### Vendoring using `component.yaml` manifest

After defining the `component.yaml` vendoring manifest, the remote component can be downloaded by running the following command:

```shell
atmos vendor pull -c components/terraform/vpc
```

:::tip
Refer to [`atmos vendor pull`](/cli/commands/vendor/pull) CLI command for more details

### Vendoring Components from a Monorepo

To vendor a component, create a `component.yaml` file stored inside the `components/_type_/_name_/` folder (e.g. `components/terraform/vpc/`).

The schema of a `component.yaml` file is as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: atmos/v1
kind: ComponentVendorConfig
metadata:
  name: vpc-flow-logs-bucket-vendor-config
  description: Source and mixins config for vendoring of 'vpc-flow-logs-bucket' component
spec:
  source:
    # Source 'uri' supports the following protocols: OCI (https://opencontainers.org), Git, Mercurial, HTTP, HTTPS, Amazon S3, Google GCP,
    # and all URL and archive formats as described in https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter
    # In 'uri', Golang templates are supported  https://pkg.go.dev/text/template
    # If 'version' is provided, '{{.Version}}' will be replaced with the 'version' value before pulling the files from 'uri'
    # To vendor a module from a Git repo, use the following format: 'github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-instance.git///?ref={{.Version}}
    uri: github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components.git//modules/vpc-flow-logs-bucket?ref={{.Version}}
    version: 1.398.0

    # Only include the files that match the 'included_paths' patterns
    # If 'included_paths' is not specified, all files will be matched except those that match the patterns from 'excluded_paths'
    # 'included_paths' support POSIX-style Globs for file names/paths (double-star/globstar `**` is supported)
    # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)
    # https://github.com/bmatcuk/doublestar#patterns
    included_paths:
      - "**/*.tf"
      - "**/*.tfvars"
      - "**/*.md"

    # Exclude the files that match any of the 'excluded_paths' patterns
    # Note that we are excluding 'context.tf' since a newer version of it will be downloaded using 'mixins'
    # 'excluded_paths' support POSIX-style Globs for file names/paths (double-star/globstar `**` is supported)
    excluded_paths:
      - "**/context.tf"

  # Mixins override files from 'source' with the same 'filename' (e.g. 'context.tf' will override 'context.tf' from the 'source')
  # All mixins are processed in the order they are declared in the list.
  mixins:
    # https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter/issues/98
    - uri: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label/0.25.0/exports/context.tf
      filename: context.tf
    - uri: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/{{.Version}}/modules/datadog-agent/introspection.mixin.tf
      version: 1.398.0
      filename: introspection.mixin.tf
```

:::warning

The `glob` library that Atmos uses to download remote artifacts does not treat the double-star `**` as including sub-folders.
If the component's folder has sub-folders, and you need to vendor them, they have to be explicitly defined as in the following example.

:::

```yaml title="component.yaml"
spec:
  source:
    uri: github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components.git//modules/vpc-flow-logs-bucket?ref={{.Version}}
    version: 1.398.0
    included_paths:
      - "**/**"
      # If the component's folder has the `modules` sub-folder, it needs to be explicitly defined
      - "**/modules/**"
```

### Vendoring Modules as Components

Any terraform module can also be used as a component, provided that Atmos backend
generation ([`auto_generate_backend_file` is `true`](/cli/configuration/components)) is enabled. Use this strategy when you want to use the module
directly, without needing to wrap it in a component to add additional functionality. This is essentially treating a terraform child module as a root
module.

To vendor a module as a component, simply create a `component.yaml` file stored inside the `components/_type_/_name_/` folder
(e.g. `components/terraform/ec2-instance/component.yaml`).

The schema of a `component.yaml` file for a module is as follows.
Note the usage of the `///` in the `uri`, which is to vendor from the root of the remote repository.

```yaml
apiVersion: atmos/v1
kind: ComponentVendorConfig
metadata:
  name: ec2-instance
  description: Source for vendoring of 'ec2-instance' module as a component
spec:
  source:
    # To vendor a module from a Git repo, use the following format: 'github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-instance.git///?ref={{.Version}}
    uri: github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-instance.git///?ref={{.Version}}
    version: 0.47.1

    # Only include the files that match the 'included_paths' patterns
    # 'included_paths' support POSIX-style Globs for file names/paths (double-star/globstar `**` is supported)
    included_paths:
      - "**/*.tf"
      - "**/*.tfvars"
      - "**/*.md"
```

### Vendoring Components from OCI Registries

Atmos supports vendoring components from [OCI registries](https://opencontainers.org).

To specify a repository in an OCI registry, use the `oci://<registry>/<repository>:tag` scheme in the `sources` and `mixins`.

Components from OCI repositories are downloaded as Docker image tarballs, then all the layers are processed, un-tarred and un-compressed,
and the component's source files are written into the component's directory.

For example, to vendor the `vpc` component from the `public.ecr.aws/cloudposse/components/terraform/stable/aws/vpc`
[AWS public ECR registry](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/public/public-registries.html), use the following `uri`:

```yaml
uri: "oci://public.ecr.aws/cloudposse/components/terraform/stable/aws/vpc:latest"
```

The schema of a `component.yaml` file is as follows:

```yaml
# This is an example of how to download a Terraform component from an OCI registry (https://opencontainers.org), e.g. AWS Public ECR

# 'component.yaml' in the component folder is processed by the 'atmos' commands:
# 'atmos vendor pull -c infra/vpc' or 'atmos vendor pull --component infra/vpc'

apiVersion: atmos/v1
kind: ComponentVendorConfig
metadata:
  name: stable/aws/vpc
  description: Config for vendoring of the 'stable/aws/vpc' component
spec:
  source:
    # Source 'uri' supports the following protocols: OCI (https://opencontainers.org), Git, Mercurial, HTTP, HTTPS, Amazon S3, Google GCP,
    # and all URL and archive formats as described in https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter
    # In 'uri', Golang templates are supported  https://pkg.go.dev/text/template
    # If 'version' is provided, '{{.Version}}' will be replaced with the 'version' value before pulling the files from 'uri'
    # Download the component from the AWS public ECR registry (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/public/public-registries.html)
    uri: "oci://public.ecr.aws/cloudposse/components/terraform/stable/aws/vpc:{{.Version}}"
    version: "latest"
    # Only include the files that match the 'included_paths' patterns
    # If 'included_paths' is not specified, all files will be matched except those that match the patterns from 'excluded_paths'
    # 'included_paths' support POSIX-style Globs for file names/paths (double-star `**` is supported)
    # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)
    # https://github.com/bmatcuk/doublestar#patterns
    included_paths:
      - "**/*.*"
```
