Backends define where Terraform stores its [state](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state) data files.

Atmos supports all the backends supported by Terraform:

- [local](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/local)
- [s3](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/s3)
- [azurerm](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/azurerm)
- [gcs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/gcs)
- [remote](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/remote)
- [consul](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/consul)
- [cos](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/cos)
- [http](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/http)
- [kubernetes](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/kubernetes)
- [oss](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/oss)
- [pg](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/pg)
- [cloud](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/cloud/settings)

## Local Backend

By default, Terraform will use a backend called [local](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/local), which stores
Terraform state on the local filesystem, locks that state using system APIs, and performs operations locally.

Terraform's local backend is designed for development and testing purposes and is generally not recommended for production use. There are several
reasons why using the local backend in a production environment may not be suitable:

- **State Management**: The local backend stores the Terraform state file on the local file system. In a production environment, it's crucial to have
a robust and scalable solution for managing the Terraform state. Storing state locally can lead to issues with collaboration, concurrency, and
consistency.

- **Concurrency and Locking**: When multiple users or automation processes are working with Terraform concurrently, it's essential to ensure that only
one process can modify the infrastructure at a time. The local backend lacks built-in support for locking mechanisms that prevent multiple Terraform
instances from modifying the state simultaneously. This can lead to race conditions and conflicting changes.

- **Collaboration**: In a production environment with multiple team members, it's important to have a centralized and shared state. The local backend
does not provide a way to easily share the state across different team members or systems. A remote backend, such as Amazon S3, Azure Storage, or
HashiCorp Consul, is more suitable for collaboration.

- **Durability and Backup**: The local backend does not provide durability or backup features. If the machine where Terraform is run experiences
issues, there's a risk of losing the state file, leading to potential data loss. Remote backends offer better durability and often provide features
for versioning and backup.

- **Remote Execution and Automation**: In production, it's common to use Terraform in automated workflows, such as continuous integration/continuous
deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Remote backends are better suited for these scenarios, allowing for seamless integration with automation tools and
supporting the deployment of infrastructure as code in a reliable and controlled manner.

To address these concerns, it's recommended to use one of the supported remote backends, such as Amazon S3, Azure Storage, Google Cloud Storage,
HashiCorp Consul, or Terraform Cloud, for production environments. Remote backends provide better scalability, collaboration support, and durability,
making them more suitable for managing infrastructure at scale in production environments.

## AWS S3 Backend

Terraform's [S3](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/s3) backend is a popular remote
backend for storing Terraform state files in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket. Using S3 as a backend offers
many advantages, particularly in production environments.

To configure Terraform to use an S3 backend, you typically provide the S3 bucket name and an optional key prefix in your Terraform configuration.
Here's a simplified example:

<Terminal>
```hcl
terraform {
    backend "s3" {
        acl            = "bucket-owner-full-control"
        bucket         = "your-s3-bucket-name"
        key            = "path/to/terraform.tfstate"
        region         = "your-aws-region"
        encrypt        = true
        dynamodb_table = "terraform_locks"
    }
}
```
</Terminal>

<br/>

In the example, `terraform_locks` is a DynamoDB table used for state locking. DynamoDB is recommended for locking when using the S3 backend to ensure
safe concurrent access.

Once the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table are provisioned, you can start using them to store Terraform state for the Terraform components.
There are two ways of doing this:

- Manually create `backend.tf` file in each component's folder with the following content:

<Terminal title="components/terraform/vpc/backend.tf">
```hcl
terraform {
    backend "s3" {
        acl                  = "bucket-owner-full-control"
        bucket               = "your-s3-bucket-name"
        dynamodb_table       = "your-dynamodb-table-name"
        encrypt              = true
        key                  = "terraform.tfstate"
        region               = "your-aws-region"
        role_arn             = "arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxx:role/IAM Role with permissions to access the Terraform backend"
        workspace_key_prefix = "component name, e.g. `vpc` or `vpc-flow-logs-bucket`"
  }
}
```
</Terminal>

<br/>

- Configure Terraform S3 backend with Atmos to automatically generate a backend file for each Atmos component. This is the recommended way
of configuring Terraform state backend since it offers many advantages and will save you from manually creating a backend configuration file for
each component

Configuring Terraform S3 backend with Atmos consists of the three steps:

- Set `auto_generate_backend_file` to `true` in the `atmos.yaml` CLI config file in the `components.terraform` section:

<Terminal title="atmos.yaml">
```yaml
components:
  terraform:
  # Can also be set using 'ATMOS_COMPONENTS_TERRAFORM_AUTO_GENERATE_BACKEND_FILE' ENV var, or '--auto-generate-backend-file' command-line argument
  auto_generate_backend_file: true
```
</Terminal>

<br/>

- Configure the S3 backend in one of the `_defaults.yaml` manifests. You can configure it for the entire Organization, or per OU/tenant, or per
region, or per account.

:::note
The `_defaults.yaml` manifests contain the default settings for Organizations, Organizational Units and accounts.
:::

<br/>

To configure the S3 backend for the entire Organization, add the following config in `stacks/orgs/acme/_defaults.yaml`:

<Terminal title="stacks/orgs/acme/_defaults.yaml">
```yaml
terraform:
  backend_type: s3
  backend:
    s3:
      acl: "bucket-owner-full-control"
      encrypt: true
      bucket: "your-s3-bucket-name"
      dynamodb_table: "your-dynamodb-table-name"
      key: "terraform.tfstate"
      region: "your-aws-region"
      role_arn: "arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxx:role/IAM Role with permissions to access the Terraform backend"
```
</Terminal>

<br/>

- (This step is optional) For each component, you can add `workspace_key_prefix` similar to the following:

<Terminal title="stacks/catalog/vpc.yaml">
```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    # `vpc` is the Atmos component name
    vpc:
      # Optional backend configuration for the component
      backend:
        s3:
          workspace_key_prefix: vpc
      metadata:
        # Point to the Terraform component
        component: vpc
      settings: {}
      vars: {}
      env: {}
```
</Terminal>

<br/>

Note that this is optional. If you don’t add `backend.s3.workspace_key_prefix` to the component manifest, the Atmos component name will be used
automatically (which is this example is `vpc`). `/` (slash) in the Atmos component name will be replaced with `-` (dash).

We usually don’t specify `workspace_key_prefix` for each component and let Atmos use the component name as `workspace_key_prefix`.

<br/>

Once all the above is configured, when you run the commands `atmos terraform plan vpc -s <stack>`
or `atmos terraform apply vpc -s <stack>`, before executing the Terraform commands, Atmos will [deep-merge](#terraform-backend-inheritance)
the backend configurations from the `_defaults.yaml` manifest and from the component itself, and will generate a backend
config JSON file `backend.tf.json` in the component's folder, similar to the following example:

<Terminal title="backend.tf.json">
```json
{
  "terraform": {
    "backend": {
      "s3": {
        "acl": "bucket-owner-full-control",
        "bucket": "your-s3-bucket-name",
        "dynamodb_table": "your-dynamodb-table-name",
        "encrypt": true,
        "key": "terraform.tfstate",
        "region": "your-aws-region",
        "role_arn": "arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxx:role/IAM Role with permissions to access the Terraform backend",
        "workspace_key_prefix": "vpc"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</Terminal>

<br/>

You can also generate the backend configuration file for a component in a stack by executing the
command [atmos terraform generate backend](/cli/commands/terraform/generate-backend). Or generate the backend configuration files for all components
by executing the command [atmos terraform generate backends](/cli/commands/terraform/generate-backends).

## Azure Blob Storage Backend

[`azurerm`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/azurerm) backend stores the state as a
Blob with the given Key within the Blob Container within the Blob Storage Account. This backend supports state locking
and consistency checking with Azure Blob Storage native capabilities.

To configure the [Azure Blob Storage backend](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/azurerm)
in Atmos, add the following config to an Atmos manifest in `_defaults.yaml`:

<Terminal title="_defaults.yaml">
```yaml
terraform:
  backend_type: azurerm
  backend:
    azurerm:
      resource_group_name: "StorageAccount-ResourceGroup"
      storage_account_name: "abcd1234"
      container_name: "tfstate"
      # Other parameters
```
</Terminal>

<br/>

For each component, you can optionally add the `key` parameter similar to the following:

<Terminal>
```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    my-component:
      # Optional backend configuration for the component
      backend:
        azurerm:
          key: "my-component"
```
</Terminal>

<br/>

If the `key` is not specified for a component, Atmos will use the component name (`my-component` in the example above)
to auto-generate the `key` parameter in the format `<component-name>.terraform.tfstate` replacing `<component-name>`
with the Atmos component name. In `<component-name>`, all occurrences of `/` (slash) will be replaced with `-` (dash).

If `auto_generate_backend_file` is set to `true` in the `atmos.yaml` CLI config file in the `components.terraform` section,
Atmos will [deep-merge](#terraform-backend-inheritance) the backend configurations from the `_defaults.yaml` manifests and
from the component itself, and will generate a backend config JSON file `backend.tf.json` in the component's folder,
similar to the following example:

<Terminal title="backend.tf.json">
```json
{
  "terraform": {
    "backend": {
      "azurerm": {
        "resource_group_name": "StorageAccount-ResourceGroup",
        "storage_account_name": "abcd1234",
        "container_name": "tfstate",
        "key": "my-component.terraform.tfstate"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</Terminal>

<br/>

## Google Cloud Storage Backend

[`gcs`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/gcs) backend stores the state as an object
in a configurable `prefix` in a pre-existing bucket on Google Cloud Storage (GCS).
The bucket must exist prior to configuring the backend. The backend supports state locking.

To configure the [Google Cloud Storage backend](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/gcs)
in Atmos, add the following config to an Atmos manifest in `_defaults.yaml`:

<Terminal title="_defaults.yaml">
```yaml
terraform:
  backend_type: gcs
  backend:
    gcs:
      bucket: "tf-state"
      # Other parameters
```
</Terminal>

<br/>

For each component, you can optionally add the `prefix` parameter similar to the following:

<Terminal>
```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    my-component:
      # Optional backend configuration for the component
      backend:
        gcp:
          prefix: "my-component"
```
</Terminal>

<br/>

If the `prefix` is not specified for a component, Atmos will use the component name (`my-component` in the example above)
to auto-generate the `prefix`. In the component name, all occurrences of `/` (slash) will be replaced with `-` (dash).

If `auto_generate_backend_file` is set to `true` in the `atmos.yaml` CLI config file in the `components.terraform` section,
Atmos will [deep-merge](#terraform-backend-inheritance) the backend configurations from the `_defaults.yaml` manifests and
from the component itself, and will generate a backend config JSON file `backend.tf.json` in the component's folder,
similar to the following example:

<Terminal title="backend.tf.json">
```json
{
  "terraform": {
    "backend": {
      "gcp": {
        "bucket": "tf-state",
        "prefix": "my-component"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</Terminal>

<br/>

## Terraform Cloud Backend

[Terraform Cloud](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/cloud/settings) backend uses a `cloud` block to specify
which organization and workspace(s) to use.

To configure the [Terraform Cloud backend](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/cloud/settings)
in Atmos, add the following config to an Atmos manifest in `_defaults.yaml`:

<Terminal title="_defaults.yaml">
```yaml
terraform:
  backend_type: cloud
  backend:
    cloud:
      organization: "my-org"
      hostname: "app.terraform.io"
      workspaces:
        # Parameters for workspaces
```
</Terminal>

<br/>

For each component, you can optionally specify the `workspaces.name` parameter similar to the following:

<Terminal>
```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    my-component:
      # Optional backend configuration for the component
      backend:
        cloud:
          workspaces:
            name: "my-component-workspace"
```
</Terminal>

<br/>

If `auto_generate_backend_file` is set to `true` in the `atmos.yaml` CLI config file in the `components.terraform` section,
Atmos will [deep-merge](#terraform-backend-inheritance) the backend configurations from the `_defaults.yaml` manifests and
from the component itself, and will generate a backend config JSON file `backend.tf.json` in the component's folder,
similar to the following example:

<Terminal title="backend.tf.json">
```json
{
  "terraform": {
    "cloud": {
      "hostname": "app.terraform.io",
      "organization": "my-org",
      "workspaces": {
        "name": "my-component-workspace"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</Terminal>

<br/>

Instead of specifying the `workspaces.name` parameter for each component in the component manifests, you can use
the `{terraform_workspace}` token in the `cloud` backend config in the `_defaults.yaml` manifest.
The token `{terraform_workspace}` will be automatically replaced by Atmos with the Terraform workspace for each component.
This will make the entire configuration DRY.

<Terminal title="_defaults.yaml">
```yaml
terraform:
  backend_type: cloud
  backend:
    cloud:
      organization: "my-org"
      hostname: "app.terraform.io"
      workspaces:
        # The token `{terraform_workspace}` will be automatically replaced with the
        # Terraform workspace for each Atmos component
        name: "{terraform_workspace}"
```
</Terminal>

<br/>

:::tip

Atmos calculates Terraform workspaces for components, and how workspaces can be overridden for each component.
:::

## Terraform Backend Inheritance

Suppose that for security and audit reasons, you want to use different Terraform backends for `dev`, `staging` and `prod`.
Each account needs to have a separate S3 bucket, DynamoDB table, and IAM role with different permissions
(for example, the `development` Team should be able to access the Terraform backend only in the `dev` account, but not in `staging` and `prod`).

Atmos supports this use-case by using deep-merging of stack manifests, [Imports](/core-concepts/stacks/imports)
and [Inheritance](/core-concepts/components/inheritance), which makes the backend configuration reusable and DRY.

We'll split the backend config between the Organization and the accounts.

Add the following config to the Organization stack manifest in `stacks/orgs/acme/_defaults.yaml`:

<Terminal title="stacks/orgs/acme/_defaults.yaml">
```yaml
terraform:
  backend_type: s3
  backend:
    s3:
      acl: "bucket-owner-full-control"
      encrypt: true
      key: "terraform.tfstate"
      region: "your-aws-region"
```
</Terminal>

<br/>

Add the following config to the `dev` stack manifest in `stacks/orgs/acme/plat/dev/_defaults.yaml`:

<Terminal title="stacks/orgs/acme/plat/dev/_defaults.yaml">
```yaml
terraform:
  backend_type: s3
  backend:
    s3:
      bucket: "your-dev-s3-bucket-name"
      dynamodb_table: "your-dev-dynamodb-table-name"
      role_arn: "IAM Role with permissions to access the 'dev' Terraform backend"
```
</Terminal>

<br/>

Add the following config to the `staging` stack manifest in `stacks/orgs/acme/plat/staging/_defaults.yaml`:

<Terminal title="stacks/orgs/acme/plat/staging/_defaults.yaml">
```yaml
terraform:
  backend_type: s3
  backend:
    s3:
      bucket: "your-staging-s3-bucket-name"
      dynamodb_table: "your-staging-dynamodb-table-name"
      role_arn: "IAM Role with permissions to access the 'staging' Terraform backend"
```
</Terminal>

<br/>

Add the following config to the `prod` stack manifest in `stacks/orgs/acme/plat/prod/_defaults.yaml`:

<Terminal title="stacks/orgs/acme/plat/prod/_defaults.yaml">
```yaml
terraform:
  backend_type: s3
  backend:
    s3:
      bucket: "your-prod-s3-bucket-name"
      dynamodb_table: "your-prod-dynamodb-table-name"
      role_arn: "IAM Role with permissions to access the 'prod' Terraform backend"
```
</Terminal>

<br/>

When you provision the `vpc` component into the `dev` account (by executing the command `atmos terraform apply vpc -s plat-ue2-dev`), Atmos will
deep-merge the backend configuration from the Organization-level manifest with the configuration from the `dev` manifest, and will automatically
add `workspace_key_prefix` for the component, generating the following final deep-merged backend config for the `vpc` component in the `dev` account:

<Terminal>
```json
{
  "terraform": {
    "backend": {
      "s3": {
        "acl": "bucket-owner-full-control",
        "bucket": "your-dev-s3-bucket-name",
        "dynamodb_table": "your-dev-dynamodb-table-name",
        "encrypt": true,
        "key": "terraform.tfstate",
        "region": "your-aws-region",
        "role_arn": "<IAM Role with permissions to access the `dev` Terraform backend>",
        "workspace_key_prefix": "vpc"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</Terminal>

<br/>

In the same way, you can create different Terraform backends per Organizational Unit, per region, per account (or a group of accounts, e.g. `prod`
and `non-prod`), or even per component or a set of components (e.g. root-level components like `account` and IAM roles can have a separate backend),
and then configure parts of the backend config in the corresponding Atmos stack manifests. Atmos will deep-merge all the parts from the
different scopes and generate the final backend config for the components in the stacks.

## Terraform Backend with Multiple Component Instances

We mentioned before that you can configure the Terraform backend for the components manually (by creating a file `backend.tf` in each Terraform
component's folder), or you can set up Atmos to generate the backend configuration for each component in the stacks automatically. While
auto-generating the backend config file is helpful and saves you from creating the backend files for each component, it becomes a requirement
when you provision multiple instances of a Terraform component into the same environment (same account and region).

You can provision more than one instance of the same Terraform component (with the same or different settings) into the same environment by defining
many Atmos components that provide configuration for the Terraform component.

:::tip
For more information on configuring and provision multiple instances of a Terraform component,
refer to [Multiple Component Instances Atmos Design Patterns](/design-patterns/multiple-component-instances)
:::

<br/>

For example, the following config shows how to define two Atmos
components, `vpc/1` and `vpc/2`, which both point to the same Terraform component `vpc`:

<Terminal>
```yaml
import:
  # Import the defaults for all VPC components
  - catalog/vpc/defaults

components:
  terraform:
    # Atmos component `vpc/1`
    vpc/1:
      metadata:
        # Point to the Terraform component in `components/terraform/vpc`
        component: vpc
        # Inherit the defaults for all VPC components
        inherits:
          - vpc/defaults
      # Define variables specific to this `vpc/1` component
      vars:
        name: vpc-1
        ipv4_primary_cidr_block: 10.9.0.0/18
      # Optional backend configuration for the component
      # If not specified, the Atmos component name `vpc/1` will be used (`/` will be replaced with `-`)
      backend:
        s3:
          workspace_key_prefix: vpc-1

    # Atmos component `vpc/2`
    vpc/2:
      metadata:
        # Point to the Terraform component in `components/terraform/vpc`
        component: vpc
        # Inherit the defaults for all VPC components
        inherits:
          - vpc/defaults
      # Define variables specific to this `vpc/2` component
      vars:
        name: vpc-2
        ipv4_primary_cidr_block: 10.10.0.0/18
      # Optional backend configuration for the component
      # If not specified, the Atmos component name `vpc/2` will be used (`/` will be replaced with `-`)
      backend:
        s3:
          workspace_key_prefix: vpc-2
```
</Terminal>

<br/>

If we manually create a `backend.tf` file for the `vpc` Terraform component in the `components/terraform/vpc` folder
using `workspace_key_prefix: "vpc"`, then both `vpc/1` and `vpc/2` Atmos components will use the same `workspace_key_prefix`, and they will
not function correctly.

On the other hand, if we configure Atmos to auto-generate the backend config file, then each component will have a different `workspace_key_prefix`
auto-generated by Atmos by using the Atmos component name (or you can override this behavior by specifying `workspace_key_prefix` for each component
in the component manifest in the `backend.s3.workspace_key_prefix` section).

For example, when the command `atmos terraform apply vpc/1 -s plat-ue2-dev` is executed, the following `backend.tf.json` file is generated in the
`components/terraform/vpc` folder:

<Terminal>
```json
{
  "terraform": {
    "backend": {
      "s3": {
        "acl": "bucket-owner-full-control",
        "bucket": "your-dev-s3-bucket-name",
        "dynamodb_table": "your-dev-dynamodb-table-name",
        "encrypt": true,
        "key": "terraform.tfstate",
        "region": "your-aws-region",
        "role_arn": "<IAM Role with permissions to access the `dev` Terraform backend>",
        "workspace_key_prefix": "vpc-1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</Terminal>

<br/>

Similarly, when the command `atmos terraform apply vpc/2 -s plat-ue2-dev` is executed, the following `backend.tf.json` file is generated in the
`components/terraform/vpc` folder:

<Terminal>
```json
{
  "terraform": {
    "backend": {
      "s3": {
        "acl": "bucket-owner-full-control",
        "bucket": "your-dev-s3-bucket-name",
        "dynamodb_table": "your-dev-dynamodb-table-name",
        "encrypt": true,
        "key": "terraform.tfstate",
        "region": "your-aws-region",
        "role_arn": "<IAM Role with permissions to access the `dev` Terraform backend>",
        "workspace_key_prefix": "vpc-2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</Terminal>

<br/>

The generated files will have different `workspace_key_prefix` attribute auto-generated by Atmos.

For this reason, configuring Atmos to auto-generate the backend configuration for the components in the stacks is recommended
for all supported backend types.
