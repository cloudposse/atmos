Component Inheritance is the ability to combine multiple configurations through ordered deep-merging of configurations. The concept is borrowed from Object Oriented Programming to logically organize complex configurations in a way that makes conceptual sense. The side effect of this is extremely DRY configuration.

Inheritance is accomplished by combining two features of atmos Stacks: [`import`](/docs/core-concepts/stacks/imports) and `inherits`.
