Terraform utilizes plugins known as [providers](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/providers) for
communication with cloud providers, SaaS providers, and various APIs.

In order for Terraform to install these providers, the corresponding Terraform configurations need to
explicitly state what providers are required. Furthermore, certain providers require additional configuration, such as
specifying endpoint URLs or cloud regions, before they can be used.

## Provider Configuration in Terraform

When working with Terraform, you specify provider configurations in your Terraform code. This involves
declaring which providers your infrastructure requires and providing any necessary configuration parameters.
These parameters may include endpoint URLs, cloud regions, access credentials, or any other provider-specific
configuration parameters.

To declare a provider in Terraform, use a `provider` block within your Terraform configuration files,
usually in a `providers.tf` file in the component (a.k.a. root module) directory.
The `provider` block specifies the provider type and all the necessary configuration parameters.

Here's an AWS provider configuration example for a `vpc` component. The provider config is defined in
the `components/terraform/vpc/providers.tf` file:

<Terminal title="components/terraform/vpc/providers.tf">
    ```hcl
      provider "aws" {
        region = "us-east-2"
        assume_role = "IAM Role ARN"
      }
   ```
</Terminal>

<br/>

In this example, the `aws` provider block includes the region and IAM role required for Terraform to communicate
with the AWS services.

By correctly defining provider configurations in your Terraform code, you ensure that Terraform can seamlessly install,
configure, and use the necessary plugins to manage your infrastructure across various cloud and services.

## Provider Configuration and Overrides in Atmos Manifests

Atmos allows you to define and override provider configurations using the `providers` section in Atmos stack manifests.
The section can be defined globally for the entire organization, OU/tenant, account, region, or per component.

For example, the `providers` section at the global scope can look like this:

<Terminal title="stacks/orgs/acme/_defaults.yaml">
    ```yaml
    terraform:
      providers:
        aws:
          region: "us-east-2"
          assume_role: "IAM Role ARN"
    ```
</Terminal>

<br/>

Similarly, it can be defined (or overridden) at the OU/tenant, account and region scopes in the corresponding
`_defaults.yaml` stack manifests.

If you want to override a provider configuration for a specific component, use the `component.terraform.<component>.providers`
section. For example, the following config can be used to override the `assume_role` parameter just for the `vpc` component:

<Terminal title="stacks/catalog/vpc/defaults.yaml">
    ```yaml
    components:
      terraform:
        vpc:
          providers:
            aws:
             assume_role: "IAM Role ARN for VPC"
    ```
</Terminal>

<br/>

You can include the `providers` sections in any Atmos stack manifest at any level of inheritance. Atmos will process,
deep-merge and override all the `providers` configurations for a component in the following order:

- Global scopes (`terraform.providers` sections for the Org, OUs, accounts and regions)
- Base component scope (`component.terraform.<base_component>.providers` section)
- Current component scope (`component.terraform.<component>.providers` section)

<br/>

:::tip
Refer to [Atmos Component Inheritance](/core-concepts/components/inheritance) for more information on all types of component inheritance
supported by Atmos
:::

<br/>

When you define the `providers` sections, Atmos processes the inheritance chain for a component and generates a
file `providers_override.tf.json` in the component's folder with the final values for all the defined providers.

For example:

<Terminal title="atmos terraform plan vpc -s plat-ue2-prod --logs-level=Trace">
    ```console
    > atmos terraform plan vpc -s plat-ue2-prod --logs-level=Trace

    Variables for the component 'vpc' in the stack 'plat-ue2-prod':
      environment: ue2
      max_subnet_count: 3
      name: common
      namespace: cp
      region: us-east-2
      stage: prod
      tenant: plat

    Writing the variables to file:
    components/terraform/vpc/plat-ue2-prod.terraform.tfvars.json

    Writing the provider overrides to file:
    components/terraform/vpc/providers_override.tf.json
    ```
</Terminal>

<br/>

The generated `providers_override.tf.json` file would look like this:

<Terminal title="providers_override.tf.json">
    ```json
    {
        "provider": {
          "aws": {
            "assume_role": "IAM Role ARN for VPC"
          }
        }
    }
    ```
</Terminal>

<br/>

Terraform then uses the values in the generated `providers_override.tf.json` to
[override](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/files/override) the parameters for all the providers in the file.
