Atmos supports the [Component Overrides](/design-patterns/component-overrides) Design Pattern to modify components' configuration and behavior using
the `overrides` section in Atmos stack manifests.

You can override the following sections in the component(s) configuration:

- `vars`
- `settings`
- `env`
- `providers`
- `command`

The `overrides` section can be used in the global scope or in the Terraform and Helmfile scopes.

## Overrides Schema

The `overrides` section schema at the global scope is as follows:

```yaml
overrides:
  # Override the ENV variables for the components in the current stack manifest and all its imports
  env: {}
  # Override the settings for the components in the current stack manifest and all its imports
  settings: {}
  # Override the variables for the components in the current stack manifest and all its imports
  vars: {}
  # Override the providers configuration section for the Terraform components in the current stack manifest and all its imports
  # Note: this applies only to Terraform components in the `terraform.providers` and `component.terraform.<component>.providers` sections
  providers: {}
  # Override the command to execute for the components in the current stack manifest and all its imports
  command: "<command to execute>"
```

The `overrides` section schemas at the Terraform and Helmfile levels are as follows:

```yaml
terraform:
  overrides:
    env: {}
    settings: {}
    vars: {}
    providers: {}
    command: "<command to execute>"

helmfile:
  overrides:
    env: {}
    settings: {}
    vars: {}
    command: "<command to execute>"
```

You can include the `overrides`, `terraform.overrides` and `helmfile.overrides` sections in any Atmos stack manifest at any level of inheritance.
The scope of the `override` configuration is limited to all the Atmos components defined within the manifest and all its imports up until that point.
In other words, the `overrides` configuration defined within a stack manifest does not affect any other components defined in different stack
manifests for the same top-level stack.

## Use-cases

### Overrides for Teams

The **overrides** pattern is used to override the components only in a particular Atmos stack manifest and all the imported
manifests. This is different from the other configuration sections (e.g. `vars`, `settings`, `env`). If we define a `vars`, `settings` or `env`
section at the global, Terraform or Helmfile levels, all the components in the top-level stack will get the updated configurations. On
the other hand, if we define an `overrides` section in a stack manifest, only the components directly defined in the manifest and its imports will get
the overridden values, not all the components in the top-level Atmos stack.

This is especially useful when you have Atmos stack manifests split per Teams. Each Team manages a set of components, and you need to define a common
configuration (or override the existing one) for the components that only a particular Team manages.

For example, we have two Teams: `devops` and `testing`.

The `devops` Team manifest is defined in `stacks/teams/devops.yaml`:

```yaml title="stacks/teams/devops.yaml"
import:
  # The `devops` Team manages all the components defined in the following stack manifests:
  - catalog/terraform/top-level-component1
```

The `testing` Team manifest is defined in `stacks/teams/testing.yaml`:

```yaml title="stacks/teams/testing.yaml"
import:
  # The `testing` Team manages all the components defined in the following stack manifests:
  - catalog/terraform/test-component
  - catalog/terraform/test-component-override
```

We can import the two manifests into a top-level stack manifest, e.g. `tenant1/dev/us-west-2.yaml`:

```yaml title="stacks/orgs/cp/tenant1/dev/us-west-2.yaml"
import:
  - mixins/region/us-west-2
  - orgs/cp/tenant1/dev/_defaults
  # Import all components that the `devops` Team manages
  - teams/devops
  # Import all components managed by the `testing` Team
  - teams/testing
```

Suppose that we want to change some variables in the `vars` and `env` sections and some config in the `settings` section for all the components
that the `testing` Team manges, but we don't want to affect any components that the `devops` Team manages.

If we added a global or Terraform level `vars`, `env` or `settings` sections to the top-level manifest `stacks/orgs/cp/tenant1/dev/us-west-2.yaml`
or to the Team manifest `stacks/teams/testing.yaml`, then all the components in the `tenant1/dev/us-west-2` top-level stack would be modified,
including those managed by the `devops` Team.

To solve this, we could individually modify the `vars`, `env` and `settings` sections in all the components managed by the `testing` Team,
but the entire configuration would not be DRY and reusable. That's where the __overrides__ pattern comes into play. To make the configuration DRY and
configured only in one place, use the `overrides` section.

For example, we want to override some values in the `env`, `vars` and `setings` sections for all the components managed by the `testing` Team:

```yaml title="stacks/teams/testing.yaml"
import:
  # The `testing` Team manages all the components defined in the following stack manifests:
  - catalog/terraform/test-component
  - catalog/terraform/test-component-override

# Global overrides.
# Override the variables, env, command and settings ONLY in the components managed by the `testing` Team.
overrides:
  env:
    # This ENV variable will be added or overridden in all the components managed by the `testing` Team
    TEST_ENV_VAR1: "test-env-var1-overridden"
  settings: {}
  vars: {}

# Terraform overrides.
# Override the variables, env, command and settings ONLY in the Terraform components managed by the `testing` Team.
# The Terraform `overrides` are deep-merged with the global `overrides`
# and takes higher priority (it will override the same keys from the global `overrides`).
terraform:
  overrides:
    settings:
      spacelift:
        # All the components managed by the `testing` Team will have the Spacelift stacks auto-applied
        # if the planning phase was successful and there are no plan policy warnings
        # https://docs.spacelift.io/concepts/stack/stack-settings#autodeploy
        autodeploy: true
    vars:
      # This variable will be added or overridden in all the Terraform components managed by the `testing` Team
      test_1: 1
    # The `testing` Team uses `tofu` instead of `terraform`
    # https://opentofu.org
    # The commands `atmos terraform <sub-command> ...` will execute the `tofu` binary
    command: tofu

# Helmfile overrides.
# Override the variables, env, command and settings ONLY in the Helmfile components managed by the `testing` Team.
# The Helmfile `overrides` are deep-merged with the global `overrides`
# and takes higher priority (it will override the same keys from the global `overrides`).
helmfile:
  overrides:
    env:
      # This ENV variable will be added or overridden in all the Helmfile components managed by the `testing` Team
      TEST_ENV_VAR2: "test-env-var2-overridden"
```

In the manifest above, we configure the following:

- The global `overrides` section to override the `TEST_ENV_VAR1` ENV variable in the `env` section. All the Terraform and Helmfile components
  managed by the `testing` Team will get the ENV vars updated to `test-env-var1-overridden`.

- The Terraform-level `terraform.overrides` section to override some Spacelift configuration in the `settings` section, a variable in the `vars`
  section, and the `tofu` command to execute instead of `terraform` in the `command` section. All the Terraform components managed by the `testing`
  Team will be affected by the new values (but not the Helmfile components). The Terraform `overrides` are deep-merged with the global `overrides`
  and takes higher priority (it will override the same keys from the global `overrides`).

- The Helmfile-level `helmfile.overrides` section to override an ENV variable in the `env` section. All the Helmfile components managed by
  the `testing` Team will get the new ENV variable value (but not the Terraform components). The Helmfile `overrides` are deep-merged with the
  global `overrides` and takes higher priority (it will override the same keys from the global `overrides`).

<br/>

To confirm that the components managed by the `testing` Team get the new values from the `overrides` sections, execute the following
commands:

```shell
atmos describe component test/test-component -s tenant1-uw2-dev
atmos describe component test/test-component-override -s tenant1-uw2-dev
```

You should see the following output:

<Terminal title="atmos describe component test/test-component-override -s tenant1-uw2-dev">
```yaml
# Final deep-merged `overrides` from all the global `overrides` and Terraform `overrides` sections
overrides:
  command: tofu
  env:
    TEST_ENV_VAR1: test-env-var1-overridden
  settings:
    spacelift:
      autodeploy: true
  vars:
    test_1: 1

# The `command` was overridden with the value from `terraform.overrides.command`
command: tofu

env:
  # The `TEST_ENV_VAR1` ENV variable was overridden with the value from `overrides.env.TEST_ENV_VAR1`
  TEST_ENV_VAR1: test-env-var1-overridden
  TEST_ENV_VAR2: val2

settings:
  spacelift:
    # The `autodeploy` setting was overridden with the value 
    # from `terraform.overrides.settings.spacelift.autodeploy`
    autodeploy: true
    workspace_enabled: true

vars:
  environment: uw2
  namespace: cp
  region: us-west-2
  stage: dev
  tenant: tenant1
  # The `test_1` variable was overridden with the value from `terraform.overrides.vars.test_1`
  test_1: 1
```
</Terminal>

<br/>

To confirm that the components managed by the `devops` Team are not affected by the `overrides` for the `testing` Team, execute the following
command:

<Terminal title="atmos describe component top-level-component1 -s tenant1-uw2-dev">
```yaml
# The `command` is not overridden
command: terraform

# The component does not get the `overrides` section since it's not defined 
# for the components managed by the `devops` Team
overrides: {}

vars:
  <variables for 'top-level-component1' in the stack 'tenant1-uw2-dev'>

env:
  <ENV variables for 'top-level-component1' in the stack 'tenant1-uw2-dev'>

settings:
  <settings for 'top-level-component1' in the stack 'tenant1-uw2-dev'>
```
</Terminal>

The `top-level-component1` component managed by the `devops` Team does not get affected by the `overrides` sections for the `testing` Team,
and the sections `vars`, `env`, `settings` and `command` are not updated with the values from the `overrides` configuration.
