The Terraform Component Remote State is used when we need to get the outputs of a [Terraform component](/core-concepts/components),
provisioned in the same or a different [Atmos stack](/core-concepts/stacks), and use the outputs as inputs to another Atmos component.

:::info

In Atmos, Terraform Remote State is implemented by using these modules:

- [terraform-provider-utils](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-provider-utils) - The Cloud Posse Terraform Provider for various utilities,
  including stack configuration management

- [remote-state](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-yaml-stack-config/tree/main/modules/remote-state) - Terraform module that loads and processes
  stack configurations from YAML sources and returns remote state outputs for Terraform components

:::

<br/>

[terraform-provider-utils](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-provider-utils) is implemented in [Go](https://go.dev/) and uses Atmos `Go`
modules to work with [Atmos CLI config](/cli/configuration) and [Atmos stacks](/core-concepts/stacks). The provider processes stack
configurations to get the final config for an Atmos component in an Atmos stack. The final component config is then used by
the [remote-state](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-yaml-stack-config/tree/main/modules/remote-state) Terraform module to return the remote
state for the component in the stack.

<br/>

:::info Disambiguation

- **Terraform Component** is a [Terraform Root Module](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules#the-root-module) and stored typically in `components/terraform/$name`
  that consists of the resources defined in the `.tf` files in a working directory
  (e.g. [components/terraform/infra/vpc](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/tree/master/examples/quick-start/components/terraform/vpc))

- **Atmos Component** provides configuration (variables and other settings) for a component and is defined in one or more Atmos stack manifests
  (a.k.a. stack conffig files)

:::

<br/>

## Example

Here is an example.

Suppose that we need to provision two Terraform components:

- [vpc-flow-logs-bucket](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/tree/master/examples/quick-start/components/terraform/vpc-flow-logs-bucket)
- [vpc](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/tree/master/examples/quick-start/components/terraform/vpc)

The `vpc` Terraform component needs the outputs from the `vpc-flow-logs-bucket` Terraform component to
configure [VPC Flow Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html) and store them in the S3 bucket.

We will provision the two Terraform components in the `ue2-dev` Atmos stack (in the `dev` AWS account by setting `stage = "dev"` and in
the `us-east-2` region by setting `environment = "ue2"`).

<br/>

### Configure and Provision the `vpc-flow-logs-bucket` Component

In the `stacks/catalog/vpc-flow-logs-bucket.yaml` file, add the following default configuration for the `vpc-flow-logs-bucket/defaults` Atmos
component:

```yaml title="stacks/catalog/vpc-flow-logs-bucket.yaml"
components:
  terraform:
    vpc-flow-logs-bucket/defaults:
      metadata:
        # `metadata.type: abstract` makes the component `abstract`,
        # explicitly prohibiting the component from being deployed.
        # `atmos terraform apply` will fail with an error.
        # If `metadata.type` attribute is not specified, it defaults to `real`.
        # `real` components can be provisioned by `atmos` and CI/CD like Spacelift and Atlantis.
        type: abstract
      # Default variables, which will be inherited and can be overridden in the derived components
      vars:
        force_destroy: false
        lifecycle_rule_enabled: false
        traffic_type: "ALL"
```

<br/>

In the `stacks/ue2-dev.yaml` stack config file, add the following config for the `vpc-flow-logs-bucket-1` Atmos component in the `ue2-dev` Atmos
stack:

```yaml title="stacks/ue2-dev.yaml"
# Import the base Atmos component configuration from the `catalog`.
# `import` supports POSIX-style Globs for file names/paths (double-star `**` is supported).
# File extensions are optional (if not specified, `.yaml` is used by default).
import:
  - catalog/vpc-flow-logs-bucket

components:
  terraform:
    vpc-flow-logs-bucket-1:
      metadata:
        # Point to the Terraform component in `components/terraform` folder
        component: infra/vpc-flow-logs-bucket
        inherits:
          # Inherit all settings and variables from the 
          # `vpc-flow-logs-bucket/defaults` base Atmos component
          - vpc-flow-logs-bucket/defaults
      vars:
        # Define variables that are specific for this component
        # and are not set in the base component
        name: vpc-flow-logs-bucket-1
        # Override the default variables from the base component
        traffic_type: "REJECT"
```

<br/>

Having the stacks configured as shown above, we can now provision the `vpc-flow-logs-bucket-1` Atmos component into the `ue2-dev` stack by executing
the following Atmos commands:

```shell
atmos terraform plan vpc-flow-logs-bucket-1 -s ue2-dev
atmos terraform apply vpc-flow-logs-bucket-1 -s ue2-dev
```

<br/>

### Configure and Provision the `vpc` Component

Having the `vpc-flow-logs-bucket` Terraform component provisioned into the `ue2-dev` stack, we can now configure the `vpc` Terraform component
to obtain the outputs from the remote state of the `vpc-flow-logs-bucket-1` Atmos component.

In the `components/terraform/infra/vpc/remote-state.tf` file, configure the
[remote-state](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-yaml-stack-config/tree/main/modules/remote-state) Terraform module to obtain the remote state
for the `vpc-flow-logs-bucket-1` Atmos component:

```hcl title="components/terraform/infra/vpc/remote-state.tf"
module "vpc_flow_logs_bucket" {
  count = local.vpc_flow_logs_enabled ? 1 : 0

  source  = "cloudposse/stack-config/yaml//modules/remote-state"
  version = "1.5.0"

  # Specify the Atmos component name (defined in YAML stack config files) 
  # for which to get the remote state outputs
  component = var.vpc_flow_logs_bucket_component_name

  # Override the context variables to point to a different Atmos stack if the 
  # `vpc-flow-logs-bucket-1` Atmos component is provisioned in another AWS account, OU or region
  stage       = try(coalesce(var.vpc_flow_logs_bucket_stage_name, module.this.stage), null)
  tenant      = try(coalesce(var.vpc_flow_logs_bucket_tenant_name, module.this.tenant), null)
  environment = try(coalesce(var.vpc_flow_logs_bucket_environment_name, module.this.environment), null)

  # `context` input is a way to provide the information about the stack (using the context
  # variables `namespace`, `tenant`, `environment`, `stage` defined in the stack config)
  context = module.this.context
}
```

In the `components/terraform/infra/vpc/vpc-flow-logs.tf` file, configure the `aws_flow_log` resource for the `vpc` Terraform component to use the
remote state output `vpc_flow_logs_bucket_arn` from the `vpc-flow-logs-bucket-1` Atmos component:

```hcl title="components/terraform/infra/vpc/vpc-flow-logs.tf"
locals {
  enabled               = module.this.enabled
  vpc_flow_logs_enabled = local.enabled && var.vpc_flow_logs_enabled
}

resource "aws_flow_log" "default" {
  count = local.vpc_flow_logs_enabled ? 1 : 0

  # Use the remote state output `vpc_flow_logs_bucket_arn` of the `vpc_flow_logs_bucket` component
  log_destination = module.vpc_flow_logs_bucket[0].outputs.vpc_flow_logs_bucket_arn

  log_destination_type = var.vpc_flow_logs_log_destination_type
  traffic_type         = var.vpc_flow_logs_traffic_type
  vpc_id               = module.vpc.vpc_id

  tags = module.this.tags
}
```

In the `stacks/catalog/vpc.yaml` file, add the following default config for the `vpc/defaults` Atmos component:

```yaml title="stacks/catalog/vpc.yaml"
components:
  terraform:
    vpc/defaults:
      metadata:
        # `metadata.type: abstract` makes the component `abstract`,
        # explicitly prohibiting the component from being deployed.
        # `atmos terraform apply` will fail with an error.
        # If `metadata.type` attribute is not specified, it defaults to `real`.
        # `real` components can be provisioned by `atmos` and CI/CD like Spacelift and Atlantis.
        type: abstract
      # Default variables, which will be inherited and can be overridden in the derived components
      vars:
        public_subnets_enabled: false
        nat_gateway_enabled: false
        nat_instance_enabled: false
        max_subnet_count: 3
        vpc_flow_logs_enabled: false
        vpc_flow_logs_log_destination_type: s3
        vpc_flow_logs_traffic_type: "ALL"
```

<br/>

In the `stacks/ue2-dev.yaml` stack config file, add the following config for the `vpc/1` Atmos component in the `ue2-dev` stack:

```yaml title="stacks/ue2-dev.yaml"
# Import the base component configuration from the `catalog`.
# `import` supports POSIX-style Globs for file names/paths (double-star `**` is supported).
# File extensions are optional (if not specified, `.yaml` is used by default).
import:
  - catalog/vpc

components:
  terraform:
    vpc/1:
      metadata:
        # Point to the Terraform component in `components/terraform` folder
        component: infra/vpc
        inherits:
          # Inherit all settings and variables from the `vpc/defaults` base Atmos component
          - vpc/defaults
      vars:
        # Define variables that are specific for this component
        # and are not set in the base component
        name: vpc-1
        ipv4_primary_cidr_block: 10.8.0.0/18
        # Override the default variables from the base component
        vpc_flow_logs_enabled: true
        vpc_flow_logs_traffic_type: "REJECT"

        # Specify the name of the Atmos component that provides configuration
        # for the `infra/vpc-flow-logs-bucket` Terraform component
        vpc_flow_logs_bucket_component_name: vpc-flow-logs-bucket-1

        # Override the context variables to point to a different Atmos stack if the 
        # `vpc-flow-logs-bucket-1` Atmos component is provisioned in another AWS account, OU or region.

        # If the bucket is provisioned in a different AWS account, 
        # set `vpc_flow_logs_bucket_stage_name`
        # vpc_flow_logs_bucket_stage_name: prod

        # If the bucket is provisioned in a different AWS OU, 
        # set `vpc_flow_logs_bucket_tenant_name`
        # vpc_flow_logs_bucket_tenant_name: core

        # If the bucket is provisioned in a different AWS region, 
        # set `vpc_flow_logs_bucket_environment_name`
        # vpc_flow_logs_bucket_environment_name: uw2
```

<br/>

Having the stacks configured as shown above, we can now provision the `vpc/1` Atmos component into the `ue2-dev` stack by
executing the following Atmos commands:

```shell
atmos terraform plan vpc/1 -s ue2-dev
atmos terraform apply vpc/1 -s ue2-dev
```

## Caveats

Both the `atmos` [CLI](/cli) and [terraform-provider-utils](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-provider-utils) Terraform provider use the same `Go` code,
which try to locate the [CLI config](/cli/configuration) `atmos.yaml` file before parsing and processing [Atmos stacks](/core-concepts/stacks).

This means that `atmos.yaml` file must be at a location in the file system where all the processes can find it.

While placing `atmos.yaml` at the root of the repository will work for Atmos, it will not work for
the [terraform-provider-utils](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-provider-utils) Terraform provider because the provider gets executed from the
component's directory (e.g. `components/terraform/infra/vpc`), and we don't want to replicate `atmos.yaml` into every component's folder.

:::info

`atmos.yaml` is loaded from the following locations (from lowest to highest priority):

- System dir (`/usr/local/etc/atmos/atmos.yaml` on Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%/atmos/atmos.yaml` on Windows)
- Home dir (`~/.atmos/atmos.yaml`)
- Current directory
- ENV variables `ATMOS_CLI_CONFIG_PATH` and `ATMOS_BASE_PATH`

:::

:::note

Initial Atmos configuration can be controlled by these ENV vars:

- `ATMOS_CLI_CONFIG_PATH` - where to find `atmos.yaml`. Absolute path to a folder where the `atmos.yaml` CLI config file is located
- `ATMOS_BASE_PATH` - absolute path to the folder containing the `components` and `stacks` folders

:::

<br/>

For this to work for both the `atmos` CLI and the Terraform provider, we recommend doing one of the following:

- Put `atmos.yaml` at `/usr/local/etc/atmos/atmos.yaml` on local host and set the ENV var `ATMOS_BASE_PATH` to point to the absolute path of the root
  of the repo

- Put `atmos.yaml` into the home directory (`~/.atmos/atmos.yaml`) and set the ENV var `ATMOS_BASE_PATH` pointing to the absolute path of the root of
  the repo

- Put `atmos.yaml` at a location in the file system and then set the ENV var `ATMOS_CLI_CONFIG_PATH` to point to that location. The ENV var must
  point to a folder without the `atmos.yaml` file name. For example, if `atmos.yaml` is at `/atmos/config/atmos.yaml`,
  set `ATMOS_CLI_CONFIG_PATH=/atmos/config`. Then set the ENV var `ATMOS_BASE_PATH` pointing to the absolute path of the root of the repo

- When working in a Docker container, place `atmos.yaml` in the `rootfs` directory
  at [/rootfs/usr/local/etc/atmos/atmos.yaml](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/blob/master/examples/quick-start/rootfs/usr/local/etc/atmos/atmos.yaml)
  and then copy it into the container's file system in the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/blob/master/examples/quick-start/Dockerfile)
  by executing the `COPY rootfs/ /` Docker command. Then in the Dockerfile, set the ENV var `ATMOS_BASE_PATH` pointing to the absolute path of the
  root of the repo. Note that the [Atmos example](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/blob/master/examples/quick-start)
  uses [Geodesic](https://github.com/cloudposse/geodesic) as the base Docker image. [Geodesic](https://github.com/cloudposse/geodesic) sets the ENV
  var `ATMOS_BASE_PATH` automatically to the absolute path of the root of the repo on local host

## Summary

- Remote State for an Atmos component in an Atmos stack is obtained by using
  the [remote-state](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-yaml-stack-config/tree/main/modules/remote-state) Terraform module

- The module calls the [terraform-provider-utils](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-provider-utils) Terraform provider which processes the stack
  configs and returns the configuration for the Atmos component in the stack.
  The [terraform-provider-utils](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-provider-utils) Terraform provider utilizes Atmos `Go` modules to parse and
  process stack configurations

- The [remote-state](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-yaml-stack-config/tree/main/modules/remote-state) module accepts the `component` input as
  the Atmos component name for which to get the remote state outputs

- The module accepts the `context` input as a way to provide the information about the stack (using the context
  variables `namespace`, `tenant`, `environment`, `stage` defined in the stack manifests)

- If the Atmos component (for which we want to get the remote state outputs) is provisioned in a different Atmos stack (in a different AWS OU, or
  different AWS account, or different AWS region), we can override the context variables `tenant`, `stage` and `environment` to point the module to
  the correct stack. For example, if the component is provisioned in a different AWS region (let's say `us-west-2`), we can set `environment = "uw2"`,
  and the [remote-state](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-yaml-stack-config/tree/main/modules/remote-state) module will get the remote state
  outputs for the Atmos component provisioned in that region
