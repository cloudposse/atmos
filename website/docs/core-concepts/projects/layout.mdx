<Intro>
At the root of your project, you’ll typically find an `atmos.yaml` configuration file. This file defines how Atmos should discover your stack files for configuration and your Terraform root modules as components.

Next, you’ll have a `components/` folder containing all your components, usually organized by your toolchain. For example, all your Terraform components would be in the `terraform/` subfolder within `components/`.

Finally, you’ll have your stacks configurations, which are organized into multiple subfolders depending on their purpose:

## Recommended Filesystem Layout
<dl>
    <dt>`components/`</dt>
    <dd>folder containing all your components, usually organized by your toolchain</dd>

    <dt>`components/terraform`</dt>
    <dd>folder for all Terraform "root modules"</dd>

    <dt>`stacks/orgs/`</dt>
    <dd>folder for deployable stacks</dd>

    <dt>`stacks/catalog/`</dt>
    <dd>folder for the service catalog</dd>

    <dt>`stacks/workflows/`</dt>
    <dd>folder for workflows that operate on top of stacks.</dd>
</dl>

We provide detailed guidance on organizing your folder structure, whether it’s for a simple project or enterprise-scale architecture. 

Remember, you can’t optimize for everything at once, so choose the model that best fits the stage you plan to reach when you complete the project.
