At the root of your project, you’ll typically find an `atmos.yaml` configuration file. This file defines how Atmos should discover your stack files for configuration and your Terraform root modules as components.

## Recommended Filesystem Layout

Atmos is fully configurable, and you can organize your project in any way that makes sense for your team by adjusting the paths in [`atmos.yaml`](/core-concepts/projects/configuration). We also provide detailed guidance on organizing your folder structure, whether it's for a simple project or enterprise-scale architecture in our [Design Patterns](/design-patterns) section. For complex organizational structures, see the [Organizational Structure Configuration](/design-patterns/organizational-structure-configuration) pattern. Choose the model that best fits the stage you plan to reach when you complete the project.

Here's a simple layout, if you just have 3 deployments for things like dev, staging, and prod:
```plaintext
├── components/          # Folder containing all your components, usually organized by toolchain
│   └── terraform/       # Folder for all Terraform "root modules"
└── stacks/
    ├── deploy/          # Folder for deployable stacks
    │   ├── dev/         # Folder for development environment configurations
    │   ├── staging/     # Folder for staging environment configurations
    │   └── prod/        # Folder for production environment configurations
    ├── catalog/         # Folder for the service catalog
    ├── schemas/         # Folder for the schema validations
    └── workflows/       # Folder for workflows that operate on top of stacks
```

Alternatively, here’s a more complex layout for a larger project broken into multiple organizations, organizational units, and environments:

```plaintext
├── components/                  # Folder containing all your components, usually organized by toolchain
│   └── terraform/               # Folder for all Terraform "root modules"
└── stacks/
    ├── orgs/                    # Folder for deployable stacks
    │   └── acme/                # Folder for the Acme organization
    │       ├── core/            # OU for core services
    │       │   ├── security/    # Folder for security-related configurations
    │       │   ├── audit/       # Folder for audit-related configurations
    │       │   ├── identity/    # Folder for identity management configurations
    │       │   └── network/     # Folder for networking-related configurations
    │       └── plat/            # OU for platform environments
    │           ├── dev/         # Folder for development environment configurations
    │           ├── staging/     # Folder for staging environment configurations
    │           └── prod/        # Folder for production environment configurations
    ├── catalog/                 # Folder for the service catalog
    ├── schemas/                 # Folder for the schema validations
    └── workflows/               # Folder for workflows that operate on top of stacks
```

Note, that these are just a couple of examples.

<dl>
    <dt>`components/`</dt>
    <dd>folder containing all your components, usually organized by your toolchain</dd>

    <dt>`components/terraform`</dt>
    <dd>folder for all Terraform "root modules"</dd>

    <dt>`stacks/orgs/`</dt>
    <dd>folder for deployable stacks</dd>

    <dt>`stacks/catalog/`</dt>
    <dd>folder for the service catalog</dd>

    <dt>`stacks/workflows/`</dt>
    <dd>folder for workflows that operate on top of stacks.</dd>
</dl>

You can find some demos of how we organize projects in the Atmos GitHub repository under the [`examples/`](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/tree/main/examples) folder. Or check out our [Reference Architecture for AWS](https://docs.cloudposse.com/learn) for a more detailed look at how we organize our projects.

To effectively organize an Atmos project, we want to ensure you have specific locations for Atmos to find your stack configurations and components. At a minimum, we recommend the following folder structure in your project:

## Components Folder

This folder will contain all your components. Organize the components by toolchain. For example, if you have components for Terraform, place them in a Terraform subfolder (e.g. `components/terraform/vpc`).

### Organizing Components for Version Management

Beyond the basic toolchain organization, you can further structure your components folder to support different [version management patterns](/design-patterns/version-management). The way you organize component folders determines how you manage versions across environments.

**Simple Folder Structure (Continuous Version Deployment)**

All environments reference the same component folder and converge to the same version:

```plaintext
components/
└── terraform/
    ├── vpc/              # Single version for all environments
    ├── eks/              # Single version for all environments
    └── rds/              # Single version for all environments
```

**Release Track/Channel Structure**

Components organized by maturity level or environment stage:

```plaintext
components/
└── terraform/
    ├── alpha/           # Alpha track (development)
    │   ├── vpc/
    │   └── eks/
    ├── beta/            # Beta track (staging)
    │   ├── vpc/
    │   └── eks/
    └── prod/            # Production track
        ├── vpc/
        └── eks/
```

**Versioned Folder Structure**

Components organized by explicit version numbers:

```plaintext
components/
└── terraform/
    └── vpc/
        ├── 1.2/         # Major.minor version
        ├── 1.3/         # Major.minor version
        └── 2.0/         # Breaking change version
```

**Environment-Specific Structure**

Each environment has its own component implementation:

```plaintext
components/
└── terraform/
    ├── dev/
    │   ├── vpc/
    │   └── eks/
    ├── staging/
    │   ├── vpc/
    │   └── eks/
    └── prod/
        ├── vpc/
        └── eks/
```

:::tip Choose Your Version Management Strategy
The component folder structure you choose determines how you manage versions across environments. See [Version Management Patterns](/design-patterns/version-management) for detailed guidance on choosing the right approach for your organization:

- **[Continuous Version Deployment](/design-patterns/version-management/continuous-version-deployment)** - Recommended default with automatic convergence
- **[Release Tracks/Channels](/design-patterns/version-management/release-tracks-channels)** - Progressive rollout through named channels
- **[Folder-Based Versioning](/design-patterns/version-management/folder-based-versioning)** - Explicit version boundaries
- **[Strict Version Pinning](/design-patterns/version-management/strict-version-pinning)** - Maximum control with explicit versions

Each pattern has different trade-offs between operational overhead, convergence speed, and rollback capabilities.

## Stack Configurations Folder

Next, you’ll have your stacks configurations, which are organized into multiple subfolders depending on their purpose:

### Schema Validations

This folder contains the [JSON or OPA schemas used to validate the stack configurations](/core-concepts/validate).

### Catalogs

This should be a separate top-level folder containing your stack configurations. Stack configurations are divided into several parts:
- **Schemas Folder**: This folder contains the schemas used to validate the stack configurations.
- **Catalog Folder**: This includes all reusable imports, which can be organized into subfolders based on logical groupings.
- **Stacks Folder**: This contains the deployable stacks. Each stack is defined in a separate YAML file.

We follow a few conventions in our reference architecture:

### Deployments

We usually organize our stacks by organization, organizational unit, and environment. For example:

- **Orgs Folder**: Represents the AWS organizations to which you deploy. You might use a folder called deploy if you have a few simple stacks.
- **Multi-Cloud Projects**: If your project involves multiple clouds, consider additional organizational strategies.
