<Intro>
At the root of your project, you’ll typically find an `atmos.yaml` configuration file. This file defines how Atmos should discover your stack files for configuration and your Terraform root modules as components.

</KeyPoints>

To effectively organize an Atmos project, we want to ensure you have specific locations for Atmos to find your configurations and components. At a minimum, we recommend the following folder structure in your project:

## Components Folder

This folder will contain all your components. Organize the components by toolchain. For example, if you have components for Terraform, place them in a Terraform subfolder (e.g. `components/terraform/vpc`).

## Stack Configurations Folder

Next, you’ll have your stacks configurations, which are organized into multiple subfolders depending on their purpose:

### Schema Validations

### Catalogs
This should be a separate top-level folder containing your stack configurations. Stack configurations are divided into several parts:
- **Schemas Folder**: This folder contains the schemas used to validate the stack configurations.
- **Catalog Folder**: This includes all reusable imports, which can be organized into subfolders based on logical groupings.
- **Stacks Folder**: This contains the deployable stacks. Each stack is defined in a separate YAML file.

We follow a few conventions in our reference architecture:

### Deployable Stacks

- **Orgs Folder**: Represents the AWS organizations to which you deploy. You might use a folder called deploy if you have a few simple stacks.
- **Multi-Cloud Projects**: If your project involves multiple clouds, consider additional organizational strategies.


## Recommended Filesystem Layout
<dl>
    <dt>`components/`</dt>
    <dd>folder containing all your components, usually organized by your toolchain</dd>

    <dt>`components/terraform`</dt>
    <dd>folder for all Terraform "root modules"</dd>

    <dt>`stacks/orgs/`</dt>
    <dd>folder for deployable stacks</dd>

    <dt>`stacks/catalog/`</dt>
    <dd>folder for the service catalog</dd>

    <dt>`stacks/workflows/`</dt>
    <dd>folder for workflows that operate on top of stacks.</dd>
</dl>

We provide detailed guidance on organizing your folder structure, whether it’s for a simple project or enterprise-scale architecture. 

Remember, you can’t optimize for everything at once, so choose the model that best fits the stage you plan to reach when you complete the project.
