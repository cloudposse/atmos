Validation is essential for ensuring clean and correct configurations, especially in environments where multiple teams contribute 
to the development and deployment processes. Atmos enhances this validation process in two significant ways with [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) and [OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) policies.

Refer to [atmos validate component](/cli/commands/validate/component) CLI command for more information

Atmos supports two types of native validation.

## JSON Schema

Atmos supports [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) validation, which can validate the schema of configurations such as stacks, workflows, and vendoring manifests.
JSON Schema is an industry standard and provides a vocabulary to annotate and validate JSON documents for correctness.

## Open Policy Agent (OPA)

The [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/) (OPA, pronounced “oh-pa”) is another open-source industry standard that provides
a general-purpose policy engine to unify policy enforcement across your stacks. The OPA language (Rego) is a high-level declarative language for
specifying policy as code. Atmos has native support for the OPA decision-making engine to enforce policies across all the components in your stacks
(e.g. for microservice configurations).

This is powerful stuff: because you can define many policies, it's possible to validate components differently for different environments or teams.
