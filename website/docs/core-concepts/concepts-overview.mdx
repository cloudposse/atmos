<Intro>
Atmos is built around three core concepts: Components (your infrastructure code), Stacks (your environment configuration), and the separation between them. Understanding these fundamentals is key to using Atmos effectively.
</Intro>

## Components: Reusable Infrastructure Code

**Components** are the building blocks of your infrastructure—typically Terraform "root modules" that provision specific pieces of infrastructure.

Think of components like functions in programming: they're self-contained, reusable, and solve a specific problem. Each component does one thing well:

- A VPC component manages virtual networks
- An EKS component provisions Kubernetes clusters
- An RDS component sets up databases

**Key Principles**:
- **Generic**: Components work anywhere without environment-specific hardcoded values
- **Reusable**: The same VPC component deploys to dev, staging, and prod
- **Focused**: Each component has a single responsibility

Components live in `components/terraform/` and are standard Terraform code—no special syntax or modifications needed.

## Stacks: Environment Configuration

**Stacks** are YAML files that configure your components for specific environments. They're where you define which components to deploy and with what settings.

Think of stacks like configuration files: they bring together components with environment-specific values:

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    vpc:
      vars:
        cidr_block: "10.0.0.0/16"
        name: "dev-vpc"
```

**Key Principles**:
- **Configuration as Data**: Stacks are YAML, not code
- **Deep Merging**: Import and layer configurations to stay DRY
- **Composable**: Combine multiple components in one stack

Stacks live in `stacks/` and define the complete configuration for an environment.

## Configuration as Data

The power of Atmos comes from **separating configuration from code**:

| What | Where | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Components** | `components/terraform/` | Generic, reusable infrastructure code |
| **Stacks** | `stacks/` | Environment-specific configuration |

This separation means:
- **Components are portable**: Use the same VPC code in every environment
- **Configuration is centralized**: All settings in one place, not scattered across `.tfvars` files
- **Changes are safer**: Update configuration without touching code

## From Components to Deployed Infrastructure

Here's how it all comes together:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Component<br/>terraform code] --> C[Stack<br/>YAML config]
    C --> D[Deployed<br/>Infrastructure]
    B[vars, settings] --> C
```

1. **Write** generic Terraform components
2. **Configure** them with stacks (YAML)
3. **Deploy** with `atmos terraform apply`

The same component + different stack configuration = different environments.

## Example: VPC Across Environments

**One Component** (`components/terraform/vpc/`):
```hcl
variable "cidr_block" {}
variable "name" {}

resource "aws_vpc" "this" {
  cidr_block = var.cidr_block
  tags = {
    Name = var.name
  }
}
```

**Multiple Stacks**:

```yaml
# stacks/dev.yaml
components:
  terraform:
    vpc:
      vars:
        cidr_block: "10.0.0.0/16"
        name: "dev-vpc"
```

```yaml
# stacks/prod.yaml
components:
  terraform:
    vpc:
      vars:
        cidr_block: "10.1.0.0/16"
        name: "prod-vpc"
```

Same component, different configuration—deployed with:
```shell
atmos terraform apply vpc -s dev
atmos terraform apply vpc -s prod
```
