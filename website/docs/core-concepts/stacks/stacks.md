Stacks are a way to express the complete infrastructure needed for an environment. Think of a Stack like an architectural "Blueprint" composed
of one or more [Components](/core-concepts/components) and defined using a [standardized YAML configuration](#schema).

This abstraction layer helps to automate the orchestration and deployment of loosely coupled [components](/core-concepts/components), such as Terraform "root" modules. They enable scalable infrastructure-as-code configurations, allowing environments to inherit from one or more common bases (child stacks)
by importing configuration that gets deep-merged, thus minimizing config duplication and manual effort. Each stack uses a simple schema that provides a declarative description of your various environments. This approach empowers you to separate your infrastructureâ€™s environment configuration settings from the code it manages (e.g., Terraform components).

By facilitating the infrastructure configurations this way, developers achieve DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) architectures with minimal configuration. Stacks make infrastructure more streamlined and consistent, significantly enhancing productivity. Best of all, Stacks can deploy 
vanilla Terraform "root" modules *without* any code generation, custom vendor extensions, or changes to the HCL code.

Atmos utilizes a custom YAML configuration format for stacks. YAML is ideal because it's portable across multiple toolchains and languages; every developer understands it. The Atmos [CLI](/cli/), the [terraform-utils-provider](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-provider-utils) provider, and Spacelift via the [terraform-spacelift-cloud-infrastructure-automation](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-spacelift-cloud-infrastructure-automation) module all support stacks. Utilizing the Terraform provider enables native access to the entire infrastructure configuration directly from Terraform.

## Use-cases


## Conventions

The differentiation between the following two types of stacks is crucial for understanding how to organize stacks and the basis for the
various [design patterns](/design-patterns/).

### Parent Stacks

*Parent Stacks* are the top-level stacks that are responsible for importing Child stacks. Components inside of Parent stacks are deployable, unlike in Child stacks.

### Child Stacks

*Child Stacks* are any stacks whose components cannot be deployed independently without being imported by a Parent Stack.
[Catalogs](/core-concepts/stacks/catalogs) are typically where we keep our Child Stacks.

## Schema

A Stack file contains a manifest defined in YAML that follows a simple, extensible schema. In fact, every Stack file follows exactly the same schema, and every setting in the configuration is optional. Enforcing a consistent schema ensures we can easily [import and deep-merge](/core-concepts/stacks/imports) configurations and use [inheritance](/core-concepts/components/inheritance) to achieve DRY configuration.

```yaml
# Configurations that should get deep-merged into this one
import:
  # each import is a "Stack" file. The `.yaml` extension is optional, and we do not recommend using it.
  - ue2-globals

# Top-level variables that are inherited by every single component. 
# Use these wisely. Too many global vars will pollute the variable namespace.
vars:
  # Variables can be anything you want. They can be scalars, lists, and maps. Whatever is supported by YAML.
  stage: dev

# There can then be global variables for each type of component. 
# Here we set global variables for any "terraform" component.
terraform:
  vars: { }

# Here we set global variables for any "helmfile" component.
helmfile:
  vars: { }

# Components are the building blocks of reusable infrastructure.
# They can be anything. Atmos natively supports "terraform" and "helmfile".
components:
  terraform:
    vpc:
      command: "/usr/bin/terraform-0.15"
      backend:
        s3:
          workspace_key_prefix: "vpc"
      vars:
        cidr_block: "10.102.0.0/18"
    eks:
      backend:
        s3:
          workspace_key_prefix: "eks"
      vars: { }

  helmfile:
    nginx-ingress:
      vars:
        installed: true
```

### Stack Attributes

#### components

The `components` is the list of all the building blocks.

Example:

```yaml
components:
  sometool: # "sometool" can be any tool
    somecomponent: # "somecomponent" can be the name of any "sometool" component
      vars: # etc...
```

So for `terraform`, it might look something like this:

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    vpc:
      vars: # etc...
```

## Stack Files

Stack files can be very numerous in large cloud environments (think many dozens to hundreds of stack files). To enable the proper organization of
stack files, SweetOps has established some conventions that are good to follow. However, these are just conventions, and there are no limits enforced
by the tool.

By convention, we recommend to store all Stacks in a `stacks/` folder at the root of your infrastructure repository. This way it's clear where they
live and helps keep the configuration separate from your code (e.g. HCL).

The filename of individual environment stacks can follow any convention, and the best one will depend on how you model environments at your
organization.

### Basic Layout

A basic form of organization is to follow the pattern of naming where each `$environment-$stage.yaml` is a file. This works well until you have so
many environments and stages.

For example, `$environment` might be `ue2` (for `us-east-2`) and `$stage` might be `prod` which would result in `stacks/ue2-prod.yaml`

Some resources, however, are global in scope. For example, Route53 and IAM might not make sense to tie to a region. These are what we call "global
resources". You might want to put these into a file like `stacks/global-region.yaml` to connote that they are not tied to any particular region.

### Hierarchical Layout

We recommend using a hierarchical layout that follows the way AWS thinks about infrastructure. This works very well when you may have dozens or
hundreds of accounts and regions that you operate in. Use [Catalogs](/core-concepts/stacks/catalogs) to organize your Stack configurations.
