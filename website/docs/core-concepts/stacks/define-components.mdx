<Intro>
Stacks are used to compose multiple components together and provide their configuration. The schema is the same for all stacks, but the configuration can be different. Use a combination of [imports](/core-concepts/stacks/imports), [inheritance](/core-concepts/stacks/inheritance), and [catalogs](/core-concepts/stacks/catalogs) for a template-free way to reuse configuration and [override](/core-concepts/stacks/overrides) values when needed.

## Component Schema

A Component consists of the infrastructure as code business logic (e.g. a Terraform "root" module) as well as the configuration of that
component. The configuration of a component is stored in a Stack configuration.

To configure a Component in a [Stack](/core-concepts/stacks), you define the component in the `components` section of the Stack configuration.

:::info Disambiguation

- **Terraform Component** is a simply a [Terraform Root Module](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules#the-root-module)
  that consists of the resources defined in the `.tf` files in a working directory
  (e.g. [components/terraform/infra/vpc](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/tree/main/examples/tests/components/terraform/infra/vpc))

- **Component Configuration** provides configuration (variables and other settings) for a type of component (e.g. a Terraform component) 
  and is defined in one or more YAML stack config files (which are called [Atmos stacks](/core-concepts/stacks))
:::

The schema of an Atmos Component in an Atmos Stack is as follows:

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    # the slug of the component
    example:

      # configuration specific to atmos
      metadata:
        # Components can be of type "real" (default) or "abstract"
        type: real
        # This is the directory path of the component. 
        # In this example, we're referencing a component in the `components/terraform/stable/example` folder.
        component: stable/example

        # We can leverage multiple inheritance to sequentially deep merge multiple configurations
        inherits:
          - example-defaults

        # Settings are where we store configuration related to integrations.
        # It's a freeform map; anything can be placed here.
        settings:
          spacelift: { }

      # Define the terraform variables, which will get deep-merged and exported to a `.tfvars` file by atmos.
      vars:
        enabled: true
        name: superduper
        nodes: 10
```

### Component Attributes

<dl>

  <dt>`vars` (optional)</dt>
  <dd>The `vars` section is a free-form map. Use [component validation](/core-concepts/validate) to enforce policies.</dd>

  <dt>`vars.namespace` (optional)</dt>
  <dd>
  This is an *optional* [`terraform-null-label`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label) convention.

  The namespace of all stacks. Typically, there will be one namespace for the organization.

  Example:

  ```yaml
  vars:
    namespace: acme
  ```
  </dd>

  <dt>`vars.tenant` (optional)</dt>
  <dd>
  This is an *optional* [`terraform-null-label`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label) convention.

  In a multi-tenant configuration, the tenant represents a single `tenant`. By convention, we typically
  recommend that every tenant have its own Organizational Unit (OU).

  Example:

  ```yaml
  vars:
    tenant: platform
  ```
  </dd>

  <dt>`vars.stage` (optional)</dt>
  <dd>
  This is an *optional* [`terraform-null-label`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label) convention.

  The `stage` is where workloads run. See our [glossary](/terms) for disambiguation.

  Example:

  ```yaml
  vars:
    # Production stage
    stage: prod
  ```
  </dd>

  <dt>`vars.environment` (optional)</dt>
  <dd>
  This is an *optional* [`terraform-null-label`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label) convention.

  The `environment` is used for location where things run. See our [glossary](/terms) for disambiguation.

  Example:

  ```yaml

  vars:
    # us-east-1
    environment: ue1
  ```
  </dd>

  <dt>`metadata` (optional)</dt>
  <dd>The `metadata` section extends functionality of the component.</dd>

  <dt>`settings`</dt>
  <dd>The `settings` block is a free-form map used to pass configuration information to [integrations](/integrations).</dd>

</dl>

### Types of Components

The type of component is expressed in the `metadata.type` parameter of a given component configuration.

There are two types of components:
<dl>
  <dt>`real`</dt>
  <dd>is a ["concrete"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_class) component instance that can be provisioned</dd>

  <dt>`abstract`</dt>
  <dd>a component configuration, which cannot be instantiated directly. The concept is borrowed from ["abstract base classes"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_type) of Object-Oriented Programming</dd>
</dl>
