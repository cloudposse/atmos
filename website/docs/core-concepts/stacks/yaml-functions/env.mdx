<Intro>
    The `!env` Atmos YAML function is used to retrieve the value of an environment variable named by the key,
    and assign the result to the sections in Atmos stack manifests.
</Intro>

## Usage

```yaml
vars:
  api_key: !env API_KEY

settings:
  provisioned_by_user: !env USER
```

The value of the retrieved environment variable can be a simple type (string, number, or boolean), in which case Atmos
assigns it without modification.

If the value is a complex type (list, map or object), it must be returned as a JSON-encoded string.
After receiving the JSON-encoded string, Atmos automatically decodes it into the corresponding YAML complex type.

:::tip
You can use [Atmos Stack Manifest Templating](/core-concepts/stacks/templates) in the `!env` YAML function.
Atmos processes the templates first, and then executes the `!env` function, allowing you to provide the parameters to
the function dynamically.
