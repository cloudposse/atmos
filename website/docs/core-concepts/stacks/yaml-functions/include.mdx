<Intro>
    The `!include` function lets you load files — either local or remote — and insert their contents or specific values
    directly into sections of your stack manifests.
</Intro>

The YAML standard provides [anchors and aliases](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#3222-anchors-and-aliases), that allow you
to reuse and reference pieces of your YAML file, making it more efficient and reducing duplication.

Atmos supports YAML anchors and aliases, but the biggest limitation is that they are only available within the file in
which they are defined. You cannot reuse anchors across different files.

The `!include` Atmos YAML function overcomes this limitation by allowing you to include the content or specific values
from different local and remote sources. The `!include` function also provides the following features:

- Supports local files with absolute and relative paths.

- Supports the remote protocols provided by the [`go-getter`](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter) library.

- Allows you to use [YQ](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq) expressions to query and filter the content of the files to retrieve individual values.

- Determines the format based on file extensions. It supports files in JSON (`.json`), YAML (`.yaml`, `.yml`),
and [HCL](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl) (`.hcl`, `.tf`, `.tfvars`) formats, and automatically converts them into correct
YAML structures (simple and complex types like maps and lists are supported).
All other file extensions (including `.txt` or files without extensions) are returned as raw strings, 
allowing you to include text and [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files as strings in Atmos manifests.

Atmos resolves the `!include` functions during the initial loading of YAML files from the local filesystem or remote sources,
injecting the contents of the referenced files directly into the current location.
Files are parsed based on their extension: JSON (`.json`), YAML (`.yaml`, `.yml`), HCL (`.hcl`, `.tf`, `.tfvars`)
are converted into the appropriate type (`boolean`, `map`, `list`, etc.), while other extensions return raw strings.

## Supported File Formats

With `!include` it's possible to import multiple different file formats into Atmos configurations. File parsing is determined by the file extension:

- **JSON** - Files with `.json` extension are parsed as JSON
- **YAML** - Files with `.yaml` or `.yml` extensions are parsed as YAML
- **HCL** - Files with `.hcl`, `.tf`, or `.tfvars` extensions are parsed as HCL
- **Text** - All other extensions (including `.txt` or no extension) are loaded as plain text

<Note>
    File type detection is based on the file extension, not the content. For example, a `.txt` file containing JSON 
    will be returned as a raw string. To force any file to be included as raw text regardless of extension, 
    use the [`!include.raw`](./include.raw) function.
    
    **Important for URLs:** URLs that lack a file extension (like `https://api.github.com/meta`) will be treated as 
    plain text. If you need to parse such URLs as JSON or YAML, ensure the URL ends with the appropriate extension 
    (e.g., `.json`) or save the content to a local file with the correct extension first.
</Note>

### URL Query Strings and Fragments

When including files from URLs with query strings or fragments, the extension detection ignores these URL components:

```yaml
# Extension is detected as .json (query string ignored)
vars: !include https://api.example.com/config.json?version=2&format=raw

# Extension is detected as .yaml (fragment ignored)
settings: !include https://example.com/settings.yaml#section1

# Extension is detected from the path (query/fragment ignored)
config: !include https://example.com/data.json?v=1#field
```

## Supported Sources

### Local Sources

The `!include` function supports the following local file sources:
  - Absolute paths
    ```yaml
    vars: !include /Users/me/Documents/vars.yaml
    ```

  - Paths relative to the current Atmos manifest (where the `!include` function is executed)
    ```yaml
    vars: !include ../config/vars.yaml
    ```

  - Paths relative to the [`base_path`](/cli/configuration/#base-path) defined in `atmos.yaml` CLI config file
    ```yaml
    vars: !include stacks/catalog/vpc/vars.yaml
    ```

### Remote Sources

To download remote files, Atmos uses [`go-getter`](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter)
(used by [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) for downloading modules) and supports the following protocols to download a single file:

- **http/https** - the file must be publicly accessible (not inside a private repository)
  ```yaml
  vars: !include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/org/repo/main/path/to/vars.yaml
  ```

- **s3** (Amazon S3) - requires the correct AWS permissions and credentials configured
  ```yaml
  vars: !include s3::https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/path/to/vars.yaml
  ```

- **gcs** (Google Cloud Storage) - requires valid Google Cloud credentials
  ```yaml
  vars: !include gcs::gs://my-bucket/path/to/vars.yaml
  ```

- **scp/sftp** (SSH-based File Transfer) - requires SSH access to the remote server
   ```yaml
   vars: !include scp://user@remote-server:/path/to/vars.yaml
   settings: !include sftp://user@remote-server:/path/to/settings.yaml
   ```

- **oci** (Open Container Initiative)
  ```yaml
  vars: !include oci://ghcr.io/my-org/my-image:path/to/vars.yaml
  ```
  - The file must be exposed as part of the OCI image and exist as a layer in the image (not hidden inside layers)
  - The registry must support OCI artifact downloads (e.g., AWS ECR, Docker Hub, GHCR, GCR)

## Key Benefits of `!include`

The `!include` directive enables modular, reusable configuration patterns across all Atmos YAML files.
This has several important implications:

- **Modularization & Reuse**  
  `!include` supports a [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) approach by allowing shared configuration fragments to be stored in local or remote
   files and reused across multiple stacks or components. You can use it in place of YAML anchors, which don't work across files.

- **Preprocessing for Inheritance**  
  Includes are resolved *before* Atmos processes stacks and components, enabling powerful [inheritance](/core-concepts/stacks/inheritance/) and deep-merging
  behaviors using fully expanded configuration data.

- **Adopting Existing Terraform/OpenTofu Root Modules as Atmos Components**  
  If you're already managing your root modules using `.tfvars` files — for example, separate files for `dev`, `staging`,
  and `prod` — you can reference them directly in Atmos using `!include`. This makes it easy to adopt Atmos without
  having to translate all variables into Atmos stacks.

### Example: Referencing Different TFVAR Files Per Environment

For example, instead of rewriting existing `.tfvars` varfiles into inline YAML, Atmos lets you bring them in as-is into your [Stacks](/core-concepts/stacks/).
You can continue managing your root modules as you always have, while gaining Atmos features like stack inheritance,
environment promotion, and deep-merging.

Let's say you already have environment-specific `.tfvars` files like:

- `config/dev.tfvars`
- `config/staging.tfvars`
- `config/prod.tfvars`

You can keep using these files in Atmos by referencing them in your stack configurations:

<File title="stacks/org/dev/app.yaml">
```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    app:
      vars: !include config/dev.tfvars
```
</File>

<File title="stacks/org/staging/app.yaml">
```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    app:
      vars: !include config/staging.tfvars
```
</File>

<File title="stacks/org/prod/app.yaml">
```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    app:
      vars: !include config/prod.tfvars
```
</File>

This pattern allows you to plug Atmos into your existing Terraform/OpenTofu root modules with minimal changes — no need to
duplicate or reformat your varfiles. You also unlock additional capabilities like [listing all your stacks](/cli/commands/list/stacks)
and [components](/cli/commands/list/components), leveraging layered configurations, [stack inheritance with imports](/core-concepts/stacks/imports),
and consistent promotion of settings across environments.

## Usage

The `!include` function can be called with either one or two parameters:

```yaml
  # Download the file and inject the content directly into the current location in the YAML
  !include <file-path>

  # Download the file, filter the content using the YQ expression,
  # and inject the result directly into the current location in the YAML
  !include <file-path> <yq-expression>
```

## Arguments

<dl>
    <dt>`file-path`</dt>
    <dd>
        Path to a local or remote file
    </dd>

    <dt>`yq-expression`</dt>
    <dd>(Optional) [YQ](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq) expression to retrieve individual values from the file</dd>
</dl>

## Using YQ Expressions to retrieve individual values from files

To retrieve individual values from complex types such as maps and lists, or do any kind of filtering or querying,
you can utilize [YQ](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq) expressions.

For example:

- Retrieve the first item from a list

```yaml
subnet_id1: !include <file-path> .private_subnet_ids[0]
```

- Read a key from a map

```yaml
username: !include <file-path> .config_map.username
```

For more details, review the following docs:

- [YQ Guide](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq)
- [YQ Recipes](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/recipes)

## Handling file paths and YQ expressions with spaces

If you have spaces in the file names or YQ expressions, enclose the file paths and YQ expressions in double quotes
and use single quotes around the whole expression.

For example, on Windows:

```yaml
  vars:
    values: !include '"~/My Documents/dev/values.yaml"'
    config: !include '"~/My Documents/dev/config.json" "<yq-expression-with-spaces>"'
```

On macOS and Linux:

```yaml
  vars:
    values: !include './values.yaml "<yq-expression-with-spaces>"'
    description: !include '"component description.md"'
```
