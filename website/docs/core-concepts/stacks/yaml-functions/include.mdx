<Intro>
    The `!include` Atmos YAML function allows downloading local or remote files from different sources,
    and assigning the file contents or individual values to the sections in Atmos stack manifests.
</Intro>

## Usage

The `!include` function can be called with either one or two parameters:

```yaml
  # Download the file and assign its content to the variable
  !include <file-path>

  # Download the file, filter the content using the YQ expression,
  # and assign the result to the variable
  !include <file-path> <yq-expression>
```

## Arguments

<dl>
    <dt>`file-path`</dt>
    <dd>
        Path to a local or remote file
    </dd>

    <dt>`yq-expression`</dt>
    <dd>(Optional) [YQ](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq) expression to retrieve individual values from the file</dd>
</dl>

## Examples

<File title="stack.yaml">
```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    my-component:
      vars:
        # Include a local file with the path relative to the current Atmos manifest
        values: !include ./values.yaml
        # Include a local file with the path relative to the current Atmos manifest and query the `vars.ipv4_primary_cidr_block` value from the file using YQ
        ipv4_primary_cidr_block: !include ./vpc_config.yaml .vars.ipv4_primary_cidr_block
        # Include a local file relative to the `base_path` setting in `atmos.yaml`
        vpc_defaults: !include stacks/catalog/vpc/defaults.yaml
        # Include a local file in HCL format with Terraform variables
        hcl_values: !include ./values.hcl
        # Include a local file in HCL format with Terraform variables
        tfvars_values: !include ../components/terraform/vpc/vpc.tfvars
        # Include a local Markdown file
        description: !include ./description.md
        # Include a local text file
        text: !include a.txt
        # Include a local text file with spaces in the file name
        text2: !include '"my config.txt"'
        # Include a local text file on Windows with spaces in the file name, and get the `config.tests` value from the file
        tests: !include '"~/My Documents/dev/tests.yaml" .config.tests'
        # Download and include a remote YAML file using HTTPS protocol, and query the `vars` section from the file
        region_values: !include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudposse/atmos/refs/heads/main/examples/quick-start-advanced/stacks/mixins/region/us-east-2.yaml .vars
        # Download and include a remote JSON file and query the `api` section from the file
        allowed_ips: !include https://api.github.com/meta .api
      settings:
        config:
          # Include a local JSON file and query the `user_id` variable from the file
          user_id: !include ./user_config.json .user_id
```
</File>

## Description

The YAML standard provides [anchors and aliases](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#3222-anchors-and-aliases), that allow you
to reuse and reference pieces of your YAML file, making it more efficient and reducing duplication.

Atmos supports YAML anchors and aliases, but the biggest limitation is that they are only available within the file in
which they are defined. You cannot reuse anchors across different files.

The `!include` Atmos YAML function overcomes this limitation by allowing you to include the content or individual values
from different local and remote sources. The `!include` function also provides the following features:

- Supports local files with absolute and relative paths.

- Supports the remote protocols provided by the [`go-getter`](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter) library.

- Allows you to use [YQ](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq) expressions to query and filter the content of the files to retrieve individual values.

- Automatically detects the format of the files regardless of the file extensions. It supports files in JSON, YAML
  and [HCL](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl) (`tfvars`) formats, and automatically converts them into correct
  YAML structures (simple and complex types like maps and lists are supported).
  All other files are returned unchanged, allowing you, for example, to include text and
  [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files as strings in Atmos manifests.

## Supported File Protocols

The `!include` function supports the following local file paths:
  - absolute paths (e.g., `/Users/me/Documents/values.yaml`)
  - paths relative to the current Atmos manifest where the `!include` function is executed (e.g., `./values.yaml`, `../config/values.yaml`)
  - paths relative to the [`base_path`](/cli/configuration/#base-path) defined in `atmos.yaml` CLI config file (e.g., `stacks/catalog/vpc/defaults.yaml`)

To download remote files from different sources, the `!include` function uses [`go-getter`](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter)
(used by [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) for downloading modules) and supports the following protocols:

- `tar` - Tar files, potentially compressed (tar.gz, tar.bz2, etc.)
- `zip` - Zip files
- `http` - HTTP URLs
- `https` - HTTPS URLs
- `git` - Git repositories, which can be accessed via HTTPS or SSH
- `hg` - Mercurial repositories, accessed via HTTP/S or SSH
- `s3` - Amazon S3 bucket URLs
- `gcs` - Google Cloud Storage URLs
- `oci` - Open Container Initiative (OCI) images
- `scp` - Secure Copy Protocol for SSH-based transfers
- `sftp` - SSH File Transfer Protocol

:::tip
You can use [Atmos Stack Manifest Templating](/core-concepts/stacks/templates) in the `!include` YAML function parameters.
Atmos processes the templates first, and then executes the `!include` function, allowing you to provide the parameters to
the function dynamically.

## Using YQ Expressions to retrieve individual values from files

To retrieve individual values from complex types such as maps and lists, or do any kind of filtering or querying,
you can utilize [YQ](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq) expressions.

For example:

- Retrieve the first item from a list

```yaml
subnet_id1: !include <file-path> .private_subnet_ids[0]
```

- Read a key from a map

```yaml
username: !include <file-path> .config_map.username
```

For more details, review the following docs:

- [YQ Guide](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq)
- [YQ Recipes](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/recipes)

## Handling file paths and YQ expressions with spaces

If you have spaces in the file names or YQ expressions, enclose the file paths and YQ expressions in double quotes
and use single quotes around the whole expression.

For example, on Windows:

```yaml
  vars:
    values: !include '"~/My Documents/dev/values.yaml"'
    config: !include '"~/My Documents/dev/config.json" "<yq-expression-with-spaces>"'
```

On macOS and Linux:

```yaml
  vars:
    values: !include './values.yaml "<yq-expression-with-spaces>"'
    description: !include '"component description.md"'
```

Sometimes for more complex cases you may need to utilize 3x double quotes, for examples:
```yaml
vars:
  my_array: !include '"https://foo.com/bar.json" """.some_key.array_one + .some_key.hyphenated-field.array_two"""'
```
