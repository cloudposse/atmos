<Intro>
When you design cloud architectures with Atmos, Stacks are how you configure your [components](/core-concepts/components), bringing everything together.
</Intro>

The power of stacks comes from their flexibility: you can compose them with one or more components, reusing configurations across different environments. As your stacks grow, adding more components, it often makes sense to split them into separate files. This is where imports come in—helping you keep stack files organized and making configurations easier to reuse across multiple places.

Stacks define the complete configuration of an environment. Think of Stacks like an architectural "Blueprints" composed of one or more [Components](/core-concepts/components) configurations and defined using a [standardized YAML configuration](#schema).

Then by running the `atmos` command, you can automate and orchestrate the deployment of loosely coupled [components](/core-concepts/components), such as Terraform "root" modules. By doing this, it enables scalable infrastructure-as-code configurations, allowing environments to inherit from one or more common bases (child stacks) by importing configuration that gets deep-merged, thus minimizing config duplication and manual effort. Each stack uses a simple schema that provides a declarative description of your various environments. This approach empowers you to separate your infrastructure’s environment configuration settings from the code it manages (e.g., [Terraform components](/core-concepts/components/terraform)).

By facilitating the infrastructure configurations this way, developers achieve DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) architectures with minimal
configuration. Stacks make infrastructure more streamlined and consistent, significantly enhancing productivity. Best of all, Stacks
can deploy vanilla Terraform "root" modules *without* any code generation, custom vendor extensions, or changes to the HCL code.

Atmos utilizes a custom YAML configuration format for stacks. YAML is ideal because it's portable across multiple toolchains and languages; every developer understands it. The Atmos [CLI](/cli), the [terraform-utils-provider](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-provider-utils) provider, and Spacelift via the [terraform-spacelift-cloud-infrastructure-automation](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-spacelift-cloud-infrastructure-automation) module all support stacks. Utilizing the Terraform provider enables native access to the entire infrastructure configuration directly from Terraform.

## Use-cases

- **Rapid Environment Provisioning:** Leverage stacks to swiftly set up and replicate development, testing,
  and production environments, ensuring consistency and reducing manual setup errors. This accelerates the development
  cycle and enables businesses to respond quickly to market demands or development needs.
- **Multi-Tenant Infrastructure Management:** Utilize stacks to manage and isolate resources for different clients or projects
  within a single cloud infrastructure. This approach supports SaaS companies in providing secure, isolated environments for each
  tenant, optimizing resource utilization and simplifying the management of complex, multi-tenant architectures.
- **Compliance and Governance:** Implement stacks to enforce compliance and governance policies across all environments systematically.
  By defining standard configurations that meet regulatory requirements, businesses can ensure that every deployment is compliant,
  reducing the risk of violations and enhancing security posture.

## Conventions

The differentiation between the following two types of stacks is crucial for understanding how to organize stacks and the basis for the
various [design patterns](/design-patterns/).

### Stack Names (aka "slugs")

Each stack has a unique name used for referencing it both in configuration as dependencies and on the command line (e.g. `--stack plat-dev-ue2`). This name is automatically generated based on a template defined in [`atmos.yaml`](/cli/configuration/#default-cli-configuration).

Atmos supports two methods of configuration for defining stack names:
<dl>
<dt>`stacks.name_template` (recommended method)</dt>
<dd>
  A Go template that can reference any section of the stack configuration.

  ```yaml
  # atmos.yaml
  stacks:
    name_template: "{{ .vars.tenant }}-{{ .vars.environment }}-{{ .vars.stage }}"
  ```

</dd>
<dt>`stacks.name_pattern` (deprecated)</dt>
<dd>

  The `name_pattern` is the *legacy* method for determining stack names, retained for backward compatibility.

  It **only** supports the following optionated interpolations, and therefore is not recommended. Use `name_template` instead.
  <dl>
    <dt>`{tenant}`</dt>
    <dd>Replaced with the value from the `vars.tenant` variable in the stack configuration.</dd>
    <dt>`{environment}`</dt>
    <dd>Replaced with the value from the `vars.environment` variable in the stack configuration.</dd>
    <dt>`{stage}`</dt>
    <dd>Replaced with the value from the `vars.stage` variable in the stack configuration.</dd>
  </dl>

  For example:

  ```yaml
  # atmos.yaml
  stacks:
    name_pattern: "{tenant}-{environment}-{stage}"
  ```

  :::important Deprecated
  The `name_pattern` is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please use `name_template` instead.
  :::



</dd>
</dl>

Both options are configured in [`atmos.yaml`](/cli/configuration).

For example:

```yaml
# atmos.yaml
stacks:
  name_template: "{{ .vars.tenant }}-{{ .vars.environment}}-{{ .vars.stage }}"
```

This will use the `tenant`, `environment`, and `stage` variables from the component's configuration in the stack to compute the stack name.

For example, using the slug, we can reference a stack like this when applying the `vpc` stack in the `us2-dev` environment:

```bash
atmos terraform apply vpc -s us2-dev
```

### Components vs Component Instances

Components and Stacks are distinct concepts.

When a component is added to a stack, it becomes a **Component Instance**—essentially a deployment of that component within the stack.

### Parent Stacks vs Child Stacks

<dl>
  <dt>Parent Stacks</dt>
  <dd>These are the top-level stacks that are responsible for importing Child stacks. Components inside of Parent stacks are deployable, unlike in Child stacks.</dd>

  <dt>Child Stacks</dt>
  <dd>These are any stacks whose components cannot be deployed independently without being imported by a Parent Stack. <a href="/core-concepts/stacks/catalogs">Catalogs</a> are typically where we keep our Child stacks.</dd>
</dl>

### Logical Stacks vs. Physical Stack Manifests

<dl>
  <dt>Logical Stacks</dt>
  <dd>
      Represent the entire environment defined by context variables and global settings in atmos.yaml.
      Logical stacks are the in-memory representation of the deep-merged configuration.
    </dd>

  <dt>Physical Stacks</dt>
  <dd>Are the raw YAML files where the specific configurations of components are defined.</dd>
</dl>

Atmos processes each physical stack file, first evaluating any templates and then processing it as YAML. After loading the YAML,
it proceeds to deep-merge the configuration with the current in-memory logical representation of the Stack, then apply any overrides.
This is done iteratively for each physical stack file in the order they are defined in the `import` section of the Stack file.

Note, the logical representation is never influenced by file paths or directories. It's only influenced by the configuration itself.


## Schema

A Stack file contains a manifest defined in YAML that follows a simple, extensible schema. In fact, every Stack file follows exactly the same schema, and every setting in the configuration is optional. Enforcing a consistent schema ensures we can easily [import and deep-merge](/core-concepts/stacks/imports) configurations and use [inheritance](/core-concepts/stacks/inheritance) to achieve DRY configuration.

:::


<File title="stack.yaml">
```yaml
# Configurations that should get deep-merged into this one
import:
  # each import is a "Stack" file. The `.yaml` extension is optional, and we do not recommend using it.
  - ue2-globals

# Top-level environment variables are inherited by every single component.
env:
  AWS_REGION: "us-east-2"

# Top-level variables that are inherited by every single component.
# Use these wisely. Too many global vars will pollute the variable namespace.
vars:
  # Variables can be anything you want. They can be scalars, lists, and maps. Whatever is supported by YAML.
  stage: dev

# There can then be global variables for each type of component.
# Here we set global variables for any "terraform" component.
terraform:
  vars: { }

# Here we set global variables for any "helmfile" component.
helmfile:
  vars: { }

# Components are the building blocks of reusable infrastructure.
# They can be anything. Atmos natively supports "terraform" and "helmfile".
components:
  terraform:
    vpc:
      command: "/usr/bin/terraform-0.15"
      backend:
        s3:
          workspace_key_prefix: "vpc"
      vars:
        cidr_block: "10.102.0.0/18"
    eks:
      backend:
        s3:
          workspace_key_prefix: "eks"
      vars: { }

  helmfile:
    nginx-ingress:
      vars:
        installed: true
```
</File>

### Stack Attributes

<dl>
  <dt>`components`</dt>
  <dd>
  The `components` is the list of all the building blocks.

  Example:

  ```yaml
  components:
    sometool: # "sometool" can be any tool (typically "terraform" or "helmfile")
      somecomponent: # "somecomponent" is the name of any component managed by that tool
        vars: # etc...
  ```
  </dd>

  <dt>`components.terraform`</dt>
  <dd>
  So for `terraform`, it might look something like this:

  ```yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      vpc:
        vars: # etc...
  ```
  </dd>
</dl>



## Stack Files

Stack files can be very numerous in large cloud environments (think many dozens to hundreds of stack files). To enable the proper organization of stack files, SweetOps has established some conventions that are good to follow. However, these are just conventions, and there are no limits enforced by the tool.

By convention, we recommend storing all Stacks in a `stacks/` folder at the root of your infrastructure repository. This way it's clear where they live and helps keep the configuration separate from your code (e.g. HCL).

The filename of individual environment stacks can follow any convention, and the best one will depend on how you model environments at your organization.

### Basic Filesystem Layout

A basic form of organization is to follow the naming pattern where each `$environment-$stage.yaml` is a file. This works well until you have so many environments and stages.

For example, `$environment` might be `ue2` (for `us-east-2`) and `$stage` might be `prod` which would result in `stacks/ue2-prod.yaml`

Some resources, however, are global in scope. For example, Route53 and IAM might not make sense to tie to a region. These are what we call "global
resources". You might want to put these into a file like `stacks/global-region.yaml` to connote that they are not tied to any particular region.

### Hierarchical Filesystem Layout

We recommend using a hierarchical layout that follows the way AWS thinks about infrastructure. This works very well when you may have dozens or
hundreds of accounts and regions that you operate in. Use [Catalogs](/core-concepts/stacks/catalogs) to organize your Stack configurations.
