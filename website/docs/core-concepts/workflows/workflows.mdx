Workflows are a way of combining multiple commands into one executable unit of work.

<br/>

:::note
You can use [Atmos Custom Commands](/core-concepts/custom-commands) in Atmos Workflows, and Atmos Workflows
in [Atmos Custom Commands](/core-concepts/custom-commands)
:::

## Simple Example

Here's an example workflow called `eks-up` which runs a few commands that will bring up the EKS cluster:

```yaml title=stacks/workflows/workflow1.yaml
workflows:
  eks-up:
    description: |
      Bring up the EKS cluster.
    steps:
      - command: terraform apply vpc -auto-approve
      - command: terraform apply eks/cluster -auto-approve
      - command: terraform apply eks/alb-controller -auto-approve
```

<br/>

:::note

The workflow name can be anything you want, and the workflows can also be parameterized.

:::

<br/>

If you define this workflow in the file `workflow1.yaml`, it can we executed like this to provision
the `vpc`, `eks/cluster` and `eks/alb-controller` [Atmos Components](/core-concepts/components) into
the `tenant1-ue2-dev` [Atmos Stack](/core-concepts/stacks):

```shell
atmos workflow eks-up -f workflow1 --stack tenant1-ue2-dev
```

## Configuration

To configure and execute Atmos workflows, follow these steps:

- Configure workflows in [`atmos.yaml` CLI config file](/cli/configuration)
- Create workflow files and define workflows using the workflow schema

### Configure Workflows in `atmos.yaml`

In `atmos.yaml` CLI config file, add the following sections related to Atmos workflows:

```yaml
# Base path for components, stacks and workflows configurations.
# Can also be set using 'ATMOS_BASE_PATH' ENV var, or '--base-path' command-line argument.
# Supports both absolute and relative paths.
# If not provided or is an empty string, 'components.terraform.base_path', 'components.helmfile.base_path', 'stacks.base_path' 
# and 'workflows.base_path' are independent settings (supporting both absolute and relative paths).
# If 'base_path' is provided, 'components.terraform.base_path', 'components.helmfile.base_path', 'stacks.base_path' 
# and 'workflows.base_path' are considered paths relative to 'base_path'.
base_path: ""

workflows:
  # Can also be set using 'ATMOS_WORKFLOWS_BASE_PATH' ENV var, or '--workflows-dir' command-line arguments
  # Supports both absolute and relative paths
  base_path: "stacks/workflows"
```

where:

- `base_path` - the base path for components, stacks and workflows configurations

- `workflows.base_path` - the base path to Atmos workflow files

### Create Workflow Files and Define Workflows

In `atmos.yaml`, we set `workflows.base_path` to `stacks/workflows`. The folder is relative to the root of the repository.

Refer to [networking.yaml](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/tree/master/examples/quick-start/stacks/workflows/networking.yaml) for an example.

We put the workflow files into the folder. The workflow file names can be anything you want, but we recommend naming them according to the functions
they perform, e.g. create separate workflow files per environment, account, team, or service.

For example, you can have a workflow file `stacks/workflows/workflows-eks.yaml` to define all EKS-related workflows.

Or, you can have a workflow file `stacks/workflows/workflows-dev.yaml` to define all workflows to provision resources into the `dev` account.
Similarly, you can create a workflow file `stacks/workflows/workflows-prod.yaml` to define all workflows to provision resources into the `prod`
account.

You can segregate the workflow files even further, e.g. per account and service. For example, in the workflow
file `stacks/workflows/workflows-dev-eks.yaml` you can define all EKS-related workflows for the `dev` account.

Workflow files must confirm to the following schema:

```yaml
workflows:

  workflow-1:
    description: "Description of Workflow #1"
    steps: [ ]

  workflow-2:
    description: "Description of Workflow #2"
    steps: [ ]
```

Each workflow file must have the `workflows:` top-level section with a map of workflow definitions.

Each workflow definition must confirm to the following schema:

```yaml
  workflow-1:
    description: "Description of Workflow #1"
    stack: <Atmos stack> # optional
    steps:
      - command: <Atmos command to execute>
        name: <step name>>  # optional
        type: atmos  # optional
        stack: <Atmos stack> # optional
      - command: <Atmos command to execute>
        name: <step name>>  # optional
        stack: <Atmos stack> # optional
      - command: <shell script>
        name: <step name>>  # optional
        type: shell  # required for the steps of type `shell`
```

where:

- `description` - the workflow description

- `stack` - workflow-level Atmos stack (optional). If specified, all workflow steps of type `atmos` will be executed for this Atmos stack. It can be
  overridden in each step or on the command line by using the `--stack` flag (`-s` for shorthand)

- `steps` - a list of workflow steps which are executed sequentially in the order they are specified

Each step is configured using the following attributes:

- `command` - the command to execute. Can be either an Atmos [CLI command](/cli/commands) (without the `atmos` binary name in front of it,
  for example `command: terraform apply vpc`), or a shell script. The type of the command is specified by the `type` attribute

- `name` - step name (optional). It's used to find the first step from which to start executing the workflow when the command-line flag `--from-step`
  is specified. If the `name` is omitted, a friendly name will be generated for you consisting of a prefix of `step` and followed by the index of the
  step (the index starts with 1, so the first generated step name would be `step1`).

- `type` - the type of the command. Can be either `atmos` or `shell`. Type `atmos` is implicit, you don't have to specify it if the `command`
  is an Atmos [CLI command](/cli/commands). Type `shell` is required if the command is a shell script. When executing a step of type `atmos`,
  Atmos prepends the `atmos` binary name to the provided command before executing it

- `stack` - step-level Atmos stack (optional). If specified, the `command` will be executed for this Atmos stack. It overrides the
  workflow-level  `stack` attribute, and can itself be overridden on the command line by using the `--stack` flag (`-s` for shorthand)

<br/>

:::note

A workflow command of type `shell` can be any simple or complex shell command or script.
You can use [YAML Multiline Strings](https://yaml-multiline.info/) to create complex multi-line shell scripts.

## Executing Workflow from a Named Step

Each workflow step can be given an arbitrary name (step's identifier) using the `name` attribute. For example:

```yaml title=stacks/workflows/workflow1.yaml
workflows:
  test-1:
    description: "Test workflow"
    steps:
      - command: echo Command 1
        name: step1
        type: shell
      - command: echo Command 2
        name: step2
        type: shell
      - command: echo Command 3
        name: step3
        type: shell
      - command: echo Command 4
        type: shell
```

The step's name can be used in the `--from-step` command-line flag to start the workflow execution from the step.

For example, the following command will skip the first two steps and will start executing the workflow from `step3`:

```console
atmos workflow test-1 -f workflow1 --from-step step3
```

This is useful when you want to restart the workflow from a particular step.

For example:

- You run the workflow first time with the command `atmos workflow test-1 -f workflow1`
- `step1` and `step2` succeed, but `step3` fails
- You fix the issue with the `step3` command
- You don't want to execute `step1` and `step2` again (to not spend time on it, or if they are
  not [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence))
- You run the command `atmos workflow test-1 -f workflow1 --from-step step3` to restart the workflow from `step3`

If the `name` attribute in a workflow step is omitted, a friendly name will be generated for you consisting of a prefix of `step` and followed by the
index of the step. The index starts with 1, so the first generated step name would be `step1`.

The `test-1` workflow defined above does not have the `name` attribute for the last workflow step.
When we execute the `atmos workflow` commands, Atmos automatically generates the names for the steps where the `name` attribute is omitted.
In this case, the generated name for the last step will be `step4`.

For example:

<Terminal title="atmos workflow test-1 -f workflow1 --from-step step4">
```console
Executing the workflow 'test-1' from 'stacks/workflows/workflow1.yaml'

description: Test workflow
steps:
- name: step1
  command: echo Command 1
  type: shell
- name: step2
  command: echo Command 2
  type: shell
- name: step3
  command: echo Command 3
  type: shell
- name: step4
  command: echo Command 4
  type: shell

Executing workflow step: echo Command 4

Executing command: echo Command 4
Command 4

Executing workflow step: echo Command 5

Executing command: echo Command 5
Command 5
```
</Terminal>

## Workflow Examples

The following workflow defines four steps of type `atmos` (implicit type) without specifying the workflow-level or step-level `stack` attribute.
Since the workflow does not specify the stack, it's generic and can be executed for any Atmos stack.
In this case, the stack needs to be provided on the command line.

```yaml title=stacks/workflows/workflow1.yaml
workflows:
  terraform-plan-all-test-components:
    description: |
      Run 'terraform plan' on 'test/test-component' and all its derived components.
      The stack must be provided on the command line: 
      `atmos workflow terraform-plan-all-test-components -f workflow1 -s <stack>`
    steps:
      # Inline scripts are also supported
      # Refer to https://yaml-multiline.info for more details
      - type: shell
        command: |
          echo "Starting the workflow execution..."
          read -p "Press any key to continue... " -n1 -s
      - command: terraform plan test/test-component
      - command: terraform plan test/test-component-override
      - command: terraform plan test/test-component-override-2
      - command: terraform plan test/test-component-override-3
      - type: shell
        command: >-
          echo "All done!"
```

To run this workflow for the `tenant1-ue2-dev` stack, execute the following command:

```console
atmos workflow terraform-plan-all-test-components -f workflow1 -s tenant1-ue2-dev
```

<br/>

The following workflow executes `terraform plan` on `test/test-component-override-2` component in all stacks.
In this case, the stack is specified inline for each workflow command.

```yaml title=stacks/workflows/workflow1.yaml
workflows:
  terraform-plan-test-component-override-2-all-stacks:
    description: Run 'terraform plan' on 'test/test-component-override-2' component in all stacks
    steps:
      - command: terraform plan test/test-component-override-2 -s tenant1-ue2-dev
      - command: terraform plan test/test-component-override-2 -s tenant1-ue2-staging
      - command: terraform plan test/test-component-override-2 -s tenant1-ue2-prod
      - command: terraform plan test/test-component-override-2 -s tenant2-ue2-dev
      - command: terraform plan test/test-component-override-2 -s tenant2-ue2-staging
      - command: terraform plan test/test-component-override-2 -s tenant2-ue2-prod
      - type: shell
        command: echo "All done!"
```

To run this workflow, execute the following command:

```console
atmos workflow terraform-plan-test-component-override-2-all-stacks -f workflow1
```

<br/>

The following workflow is similar to the above, but the stack for each command is specified in the step-level `stack` attribute.

```yaml title=stacks/workflows/workflow1.yaml
workflows:
  terraform-plan-test-component-override-3-all-stacks:
    description: Run 'terraform plan' on 'test/test-component-override-3' component in all stacks
    steps:
      - command: terraform plan test/test-component-override-3
        stack: tenant1-ue2-dev
      - command: terraform plan test/test-component-override-3
        stack: tenant1-ue2-staging
      - command: terraform plan test/test-component-override-3
        stack: tenant1-ue2-prod
      - command: terraform plan test/test-component-override-3
        stack: tenant2-ue2-dev
      - command: terraform plan test/test-component-override-3
        stack: tenant2-ue2-staging
      - command: terraform plan test/test-component-override-3
        stack: tenant2-ue2-prod
```

To run this workflow, execute the following command:

```console
atmos workflow terraform-plan-test-component-override-3-all-stacks -f workflow1
```

## Atmos Stacks in Workflows

Atmos stack for the workflow commands of type `atmos` can be specified in four different ways:

- Inline in the command itself
  ```yaml
  steps:
    - command: terraform plan test/test-component-override-2 -s tenant1-ue2-dev
  ```

- In the workflow-level `stack` attribute
  ```yaml
  workflows:
    my-workflow:
      stack: tenant1-ue2-dev
      steps:
        - command: terraform plan test/test-component
  ```

- In the step-level `stack` attribute
  ```yaml
  steps:
    - command: terraform plan test/test-component
      stack: tenant1-ue2-dev
  ```

- On the command line
  ```console
  atmos workflow my-workflow -f workflow1 -s tenant1-ue2-dev
  ```

<br/>

The stack defined inline in the command itself has the lowest priority, it can and will be overridden by any other stack definition.
The step-level stack will override the workflow-level stack. The command line `--stack` option will override all other stacks defined in the workflow
itself. You can also use any combinations of the above (e.g. specify the stack at the workflow level, then override it at the step level for some
commands, etc.).

While this provides a great flexibility in defining the stack for workflow commands, we recommend creating generic workflows without defining
stacks in the workflow itself (the stack should be provided on the command line). This way, the workflow can be executed for any stack without any
modifications and without dealing with multiple workflows that are similar but differ only by the environment where the resources are provisioned.
