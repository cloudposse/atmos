<Intro>
Let's create the simplest possible Atmos stack—no imports, no inheritance, no complexity. Just a component plus configuration that works.
</Intro>

Think of this like "Hello World" for Atmos. We'll take one Terraform component and configure it with one stack file. That's it.

## Prerequisites

- [Atmos installed](/install)
- Basic Terraform knowledge
- A Terraform component (or create a simple one)

## Step 1: Create a Simple Component

First, create a basic Terraform component. We'll use a simple example that creates an S3 bucket:

<File title="components/terraform/s3-bucket/main.tf">
```hcl
variable "bucket_name" {
  description = "Name of the S3 bucket"
  type        = string
}

variable "environment" {
  description = "Environment name"
  type        = string
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "this" {
  bucket = var.bucket_name

  tags = {
    Environment = var.environment
    ManagedBy   = "Atmos"
  }
}

output "bucket_id" {
  value = aws_s3_bucket.this.id
}
```
</File>

<File title="components/terraform/s3-bucket/versions.tf">
```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"

  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = ">= 4.0"
    }
  }
}
```
</File>

:::tip
This is just an example. You can use any existing Terraform root module you have—Atmos works with vanilla Terraform.
:::

## Step 2: Create an Atmos Configuration

Create `atmos.yaml` in your repository root:

<File title="atmos.yaml">
```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    base_path: "components/terraform"

stacks:
  base_path: "stacks"
  name_pattern: "{stage}"
```
</File>

This tells Atmos:
- Where to find Terraform components (`components/terraform/`)
- Where to find stack configurations (`stacks/`)
- How to name stacks (using the `stage` variable)

## Step 3: Create Your First Stack

Now create a stack configuration for development:

<File title="stacks/dev.yaml">
```yaml
# Global variables available to all components
vars:
  stage: dev
  environment: development
  region: us-east-1

# Configure components
components:
  terraform:
    # Component instance name (can be anything)
    my-bucket:
      # Which Terraform component to use
      metadata:
        component: s3-bucket

      # Component-specific variables
      vars:
        bucket_name: "my-dev-bucket-12345"
```
</File>

Let's break this down:

- **`vars` (top level)**: Variables available to all components in this stack
- **`components.terraform.my-bucket`**: This is a component instance—a configured instance of the `s3-bucket` component
- **`metadata.component`**: Points to the actual Terraform component in `components/terraform/s3-bucket`
- **`vars` (component level)**: Variables specific to this component instance

## Step 4: Deploy Your Stack

<Terminal title="atmos terraform plan my-bucket -s dev">
```console
Planning Terraform component 'my-bucket' in stack 'dev'...

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_s3_bucket.this will be created
  + resource "aws_s3_bucket" "this" {
      + bucket = "my-dev-bucket-12345"
      + tags   = {
          + "Environment" = "development"
          + "ManagedBy"   = "Atmos"
        }
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```
</Terminal>

If the plan looks good:

```shell
atmos terraform apply my-bucket -s dev
```

## What Just Happened?

Atmos did several things automatically:

1. **Found the component**: Located `components/terraform/s3-bucket` based on `metadata.component`
2. **Merged variables**: Combined global `vars` with component-specific `vars`
3. **Generated tfvars**: Created a `.tfvars` file with:
   ```hcl
   bucket_name = "my-dev-bucket-12345"
   environment = "development"
   stage = "dev"
   region = "us-east-1"
   ```
4. **Ran Terraform**: Executed `terraform apply` in the component directory

## Add Another Environment

Creating a production stack is just another YAML file:

<File title="stacks/prod.yaml">
```yaml
vars:
  stage: prod
  environment: production
  region: us-east-1

components:
  terraform:
    my-bucket:
      metadata:
        component: s3-bucket
      vars:
        bucket_name: "my-prod-bucket-67890"
```
</File>

Deploy it:
```shell
atmos terraform apply my-bucket -s prod
```

Same component, different configuration—that's the power of separation.

## Key Takeaways

✅ **Stacks are YAML configurations** for components
✅ **Components are generic Terraform** code
✅ **Variables merge** from global to component level
✅ **Component instances** let you use the same component with different names

## What's Next

This example is intentionally simple. In real projects, you'll want to:

- **Understand YAML deeply**: Learn about [deep merge, scope, and YAML functions](/core-concepts/yaml-guide)
- **Reuse configuration**: Use [imports](/core-concepts/imports-basics) to stay DRY
- **Create variations**: Use [inheritance](/core-concepts/inheritance-basics) for component variants
- **Organize at scale**: Use [catalogs and patterns](/core-concepts/organizing-stacks)

But you've now deployed your first stack—everything else builds on this foundation.
