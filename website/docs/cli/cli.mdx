:::note Purpose
Use this command to start an interactive UI to select an Atmos command, component and stack. Press `Enter` to execute the command for the selected
stack and component
:::

## Usage

Just run the `atmos` command in your terminal to start the interactive UI. Use the arrow keys to select stacks and components to deploy.

```shell
atmos
```

- Use the `right/left` arrow keys to navigate between the "Commands", "Stacks" and "Components" views

- Use the `up/down` arrow keys (or the mouse wheel) to select a command to execute, component and stack

- Use the `/` key to filter/search for the commands, components, and stacks in the corresponding views

- Use the `Tab` key to flip the "Stacks" and "Components" views. This is useful to be able to use the UI in two different modes:

  * `Mode 1: Components in Stacks`. Display all available stacks, select a stack, then show all the components that are defined in the selected stack

  * `Mode 2: Stacks for Components`. Display all available components, select a component, then show all the stacks where the selected component is
    configured

- Press `Enter` to execute the selected command for the selected stack and component

## Screenshots

To get an idea of what it looks like using `atmos` on the command line, just [try our quickstart](/quick-start/) and run the [`atmos`](/cli) command to start
an interactive UI in the terminal. Use the arrow keys to select stacks and components to deploy.

### Components in Stacks (Mode 1)

In Atmos, you can easily search and navigate your configuration from the built-in UI.

### Stacks for Components (Mode 2)

You can also search for the stacks where a component is configured.
