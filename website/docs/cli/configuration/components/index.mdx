<Intro>
The `components` section in `atmos.yaml` defines how Atmos locates and executes your infrastructure components. Each component type (Terraform, Helmfile, Packer) has its own configuration for paths, commands, and behaviors.
</Intro>

:::important
Do not confuse this CLI configuration with [configuring components in stacks](/stacks/components).
This configuration is defined in `atmos.yaml` and specifies default behaviors like what command to run and where components are located.

## Supported Component Types

Atmos supports three built-in component types:

<dl>
  <dt>[Terraform](/cli/configuration/components/terraform)</dt>
  <dd>Infrastructure as Code for cloud resources using Terraform or OpenTofu.</dd>

  <dt>[Helmfile](/cli/configuration/components/helmfile)</dt>
  <dd>Kubernetes package management for deploying Helm charts.</dd>

  <dt>[Packer](/cli/configuration/components/packer)</dt>
  <dd>Machine image building for AMIs, VM images, and container images.</dd>
</dl>

## Configuration Structure

Each component type is configured under the `components` section:

<File title="atmos.yaml">
```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    base_path: components/terraform
    command: terraform
    # ... terraform-specific settings

  helmfile:
    base_path: components/helmfile
    command: helmfile
    # ... helmfile-specific settings

  packer:
    base_path: components/packer
    command: packer
    # ... packer-specific settings
```
</File>

## Common Configuration Options

All component types share these common configuration options:

<dl>
  <dt>`base_path`</dt>
  <dd>Directory path where components of this type are located. Supports absolute and relative paths. Relative paths are resolved from `base_path` in the root configuration.</dd>

  <dt>`command`</dt>
  <dd>Executable to run for this component type. Can be a command name (resolved via PATH) or an absolute path to a binary.</dd>
</dl>
