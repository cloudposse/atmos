<Intro>
The `stacks` section of the `atmos.yaml` defines how Atmos locates and manages your stack configurations. Think of it as the bootstrapping configuration. Here you can define the stack name pattern or template used to build the "slugs" and specify where to find stack files.
</Intro>

:::important
Do not confuse this configuration with [stack configuration](/core-concepts/stacks).
This configuration below is defined in the `atmos.yaml` and instructs atmos where to find
your stack configurations.
:::

<File title="atmos.yaml">
```yaml
stacks:
  # Can also be set using 'ATMOS_STACKS_BASE_PATH' ENV var, or '--config-dir' and '--stacks-dir' command-line arguments
  # Supports both absolute and relative paths
  base_path: "stacks"

  # Can also be set using 'ATMOS_STACKS_INCLUDED_PATHS' ENV var (comma-separated values string)
  included_paths:
    # Tell Atmos to search for the top-level stack manifests in the `orgs` folder and its sub-folders
    - "orgs/**/*"

  # Can also be set using 'ATMOS_STACKS_EXCLUDED_PATHS' ENV var (comma-separated values string)
  excluded_paths:
    # Tell Atmos that all `_defaults.yaml` files are not top-level stack manifests
    - "**/_defaults.yaml"

  # To define Atmos stack naming convention, use either `name_pattern` or `name_template`.
  # `name_template` has higher priority (if `name_template` is specified, `name_pattern` will be ignored).
  # `name_pattern` uses the predefined context tokens {namespace}, {tenant}, {environment}, {stage}.
  # `name_pattern` can also be set using 'ATMOS_STACKS_NAME_PATTERN' ENV var
  name_pattern: "{tenant}-{environment}-{stage}"
  # `name_template` is a Golang template.
  # For the template tokens, and you can use any Atmos sections and attributes that the Atmos command
  # `atmos describe component <component> -s <stack>` generates (refer to https://atmos.tools/cli/commands/describe/component).
  # `name_template` can also be set using 'ATMOS_STACKS_NAME_TEMPLATE' ENV var
  # name_template: "{{.vars.tenant}}-{{.vars.environment}}-{{.vars.stage}}"
```

- `stacks.base_path` specifies the path to the folder where **all** Atmos stack config files (stack manifests) are defined.
  If the global `base_path` is not provided or is an empty string, `stacks.base_path` is an independent setting that supports both absolute and
  relative paths. If the global `base_path` is defined, `stacks.base_path` is relative to the global `base_path`

- `stacks.included_paths` tells Atmos where to search for the top-level stack manifests

  :::note
  Atmos top-level stack manifests are configuration files that define **all** settings and components for the corresponding environment (organization,
  OU/tenant, account, region), and they are used in `atmos` CLI commands like `atmos terraform plan <component> -s <top-level-stack>` and
  `atmos terraform apply <component> -s <top-level-stack>`
  :::

- `stacks.excluded_paths` tells Atmos which paths from `stacks.included_paths` to exclude. For example, we will exclude the config files that don't
  contain the top-level stack manifests, but just define the default values that get imported into top-level stack manifests

  :::note
  The `_defaults.yaml` files is the recommended way to define the stack manifests with the
  default configurations for organizations, OUs/tenants, accounts and regions. The `_defaults.yaml` files themselves are not top-level Atmos stacks,
  they just contain the default values for the organizations, OUs/tenants, accounts and regions (to make the entire configuration reusable and DRY)
  :::

- `stacks.name_pattern` configures the name pattern for the top-level Atmos stacks using the context variables `namespace`, `tenant`, `environment`
  and `stage` as the tokens. Depending on the structure of your organization, OUs, accounts and regions, set `stacks.name_pattern` to the
  following:

  - `name_pattern: {stage}` - if you use just one region and a few accounts (stages) in just one organization and one OU. In this case, the
    top-level Atmos stacks will use just the `stage` (account) in their names, and to provision the Atmos components in the top-level stacks, you will
    be executing Atmos commands like `atmos terraform apply <component> --stack dev`, `atmos terraform apply <component> --stack staging`
    and `atmos terraform apply <component> --stack prod`

  - `name_pattern: {environment}-{stage}` - if you have multiple regions and accounts (stages) in just one organization and one OU. In this case, the
    top-level Atmos stacks will use the `environment` (region) and `stage` (account) in their names, and to provision the Atmos components in the
    top-level stacks, you will be executing Atmos commands
    like `atmos terraform apply <component> --stack ue2-dev`, `atmos terraform apply <component> --stack uw2-staging`
    and `atmos terraform apply <component> --stack ue1-prod`. Note that the `name_pattern` can also be defined
    as `{stage}-{environment}`, in which case the Atmos commands will look like `atmos terraform apply <component> --stack dev-ue2`

  - `name_pattern: {tenant}-{environment}-{stage}` - if you have multiple regions, OUs (tenants) and accounts (stages) in just one organization. In
    this case, the top-level Atmos stacks will use the `tenant`, `environment` (region) and `stage` (account) in their names, and to provision the
    Atmos components in the top-level stacks, you will be executing Atmos commands
    like `atmos terraform apply <component> --stack plat-ue2-dev`, `atmos terraform apply <component> --stack core-uw2-staging`
    and `atmos terraform apply <component> --stack plat-ue1-prod`, where `plat` and `core` are the OUs/tenants in your organization

  - `name_pattern: {namespace}-{tenant}-{environment}-{stage}` - if you have a multi-org, multi-tenant, multi-account and multi-region architecture.
    In this case, the top-level Atmos stacks will use the `namespace`, `tenant`, `environment` (region) and `stage` (account) in their names, and to
    provision the Atmos components in the top-level stacks, you will be executing Atmos commands
    like `atmos terraform apply <component> --stack org1-plat-ue2-dev`, `atmos terraform apply <component> --stack org2-core-uw2-staging`
    and `atmos terraform apply <component> --stack org2-plat-ue1-prod`, where `org1` and `org2` are the organization names (defined as `namespace` in
    the corresponding `_defaults.yaml` config files for the organizations)

- `stacks.name_template` serves the same purpose as `stacks.name_pattern` (defines the naming convention for the top-level Atmos stacks), but
  provides much more functionality. Instead of using the predefined context variables as tokens, it uses [Go templates](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template).
  [Sprig Functions](https://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) are supported as well

  - For the `Go` template tokens, and you can use any Atmos sections (e.g. `vars`, `providers`, `settings`)
    that the Atmos command [`atmos describe component <component> -s <stack>`](/cli/commands/describe/component) generates
    for a component in a stack.

  - `name_template: "{{.vars.tenant}}-{{.vars.environment}}-{{.vars.stage}}"` defines the same name pattern for the top-level
    Atmos stacks as `name_pattern: "{tenant}-{environment}-{stage}"` does

  - Since `stacks.name_template` allows using any variables form the `vars` section (and other sections), you can define
    your own naming convention for your organization or for different clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP). For example, in the
    corresponding `_defaults.yaml` stack manifests, you can use the following variables:

    - `org` instead of `namespace`
    - `division` instead of `tenant`
    - `region` instead of `environment`
    - `account` instead of `stage`

    Then define the following `stacks.name_template` in `atmos.yaml`:

    ```yaml title="atmos.yaml"
    stacks:
      name_template: "{{.vars.division}}-{{.vars.account}}-{{.vars.region}}"
    ```

    You will be able to execute all Atmos commands using the newly defined naming convention:

    ```shell
    atmos terraform plan <component> -s <division-account-region>
    atmos terraform apply <component> -s <division-account-region>
    atmos describe component <component> -s <division-account-region>
    ```

    :::note
    Use either `stacks.name_pattern` or `stacks.name_template` to define the naming convention for the top-level Atmos stacks.

    `stacks.name_template` has higher priority.

    If `stacks.name_template` is specified, `stacks.name_pattern` will be ignored.
