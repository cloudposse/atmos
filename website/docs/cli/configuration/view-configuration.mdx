<Intro>
Atmos is a framework for defining cloud architectures in YAML. To understand what the fully-deep merged configuration will look like, you can describe it.
</Intro>

In Stacks, you define configurations for all Components, setting up small units of infrastructure like VPCs, Clusters, and Databases. Atmos lets you combine these components into reusable, nestable Stacks using Imports. You can break down everything from simple websites to full-blown multi-account/multi-subscription cloud architectures into components.

Use the following commands to view your merged configurations:

- [**`atmos describe stacks`**](/cli/commands/describe/stacks) - View the fully-deep merged stack configurations
- [**`atmos describe component`**](/cli/commands/describe/component) - View the merged configuration for a specific component
