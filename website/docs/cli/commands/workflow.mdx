<br/>

An Atmos workflow is a series of steps that are run in order to achieve some outcome. Every workflow has a name and is
easily executed from the
command line by calling `atmos workflow`. Use workflows to orchestrate any number of commands. Workflows can call
any `atmos` subcommand (including
[Atmos Custom Commands](/core-concepts/custom-commands)), shell commands, and have access to the stack configurations.

:::note
You can use [Atmos Custom Commands](/core-concepts/custom-commands) in [Atmos Workflows](/core-concepts/workflows),
and [Atmos Workflows](/core-concepts/workflows)
in [Atmos Custom Commands](/core-concepts/custom-commands)
:::

## Usage

Execute the `atmos workflow` command like this:

```shell
atmos workflow <workflow_name> --file <workflow_file> [options]
```


## Screenshots

### Workflow UI

Just run `atmos workflow` to start an interactive UI to view, search and execute the configured Atmos
workflows:

```shell
atmos workflow
```

- Use the `right/left` arrow keys to navigate between the "Workflow Manifests", "Workflows" and the selected workflow
  views

- Use the `up/down` arrow keys (or the mouse wheel) to select a workflow manifest and a workflow to execute

- Use the `/` key to filter/search for the workflow manifests and workflows in the corresponding views

- Press `Enter` to execute the selected workflow from the selected workflow manifest starting with the selected step

### Execute a Workflow

<Terminal title="atmos workflow (interactive)">
![`atmos workflow` CLI command 2](/img/cli/workflow/atmos-workflow-command-2.png)
</Terminal>

### Run Any Workflow Step

Use the `Tab` key to flip the 3rd column view between the selected workflow steps and full workflow definition.
For example:

<br/>
<Terminal title="atmos workflow (interactive)">
![`atmos workflow` CLI command 3](/img/cli/workflow/atmos-workflow-command-3.png)
</Terminal>

## Examples

```shell
atmos workflow
atmos workflow plan-all-vpc --file networking
atmos workflow apply-all-components -f networking --dry-run
atmos workflow test-1 -f workflow1 --from-step step2
```
