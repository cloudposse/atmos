:::note Purpose
This command starts a new `SHELL` configured with the environment for an Atmos component in a Stack to allow executing all native terraform commands
inside the shell without using any atmos-specific arguments and flags.

<Screengrab title="atmos terraform shell --help" slug="atmos-terraform-shell--help" />

## Usage

Execute the `terraform shell` command like this:

```shell
atmos terraform shell <component> -s <stack>
```

The command configures the environment for an Atmos component in a stack and starts a new shell suitable for executing all terraform commands natively
without going through Atmos.

The command does the following:

- Processes the stack manifests, generates the required variables for the Atmos component in the stack, and writes them to a file in the
  component's folder

- Generates a backend config file for the Atmos component in the stack and writes it to a file in the component's folder (or as specified by the
  [Atmos configuration setting](/cli/configuration))

- Creates a `terraform` workspace for the component in the stack

- Drops the user into a separate shell (process) with all the required paths and ENV vars set

- Inside the shell, the user can execute all `terraform` commands using the native syntax

- Atmos sets the `ATMOS_SHLVL` environment variable to track the nesting level of shells:
    - If `ATMOS_SHLVL` is not already set, Atmos initializes it to `1`.
    - If `ATMOS_SHLVL` is already set, Atmos increments its value by `1` for each new nested shell.
