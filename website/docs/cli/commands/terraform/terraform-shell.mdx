inside the shell without using any atmos-specific arguments and flags.

## Usage

Execute the `terraform shell` command like this:

```shell
atmos terraform shell <component> -s <stack>
```

The command configures the environment for an Atmos component in a stack and starts a new shell suitable for executing all terraform commands natively
without going through Atmos.

The command does the following:

- Processes the stack manifests, generates the required variables for the Atmos component in the stack, and writes them to a file in the
  component's folder

- Generates a backend config file for the Atmos component in the stack and writes it to a file in the component's folder (or as specified by the
  [Atmos configuration setting](/cli/configuration))

- Creates a `terraform` workspace for the component in the stack

- Drops the user into a separate shell (process) with all the required paths and ENV vars set

- Inside the shell, the user can execute all `terraform` commands using the native syntax
