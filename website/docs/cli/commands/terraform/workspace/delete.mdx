<Intro>
Use this command to delete a Terraform workspace for an Atmos component in a stack.
</Intro>

<Screengrab title="atmos terraform workspace delete --help" slug="atmos-terraform-workspace-delete--help" />

## Usage

Execute the `terraform workspace delete` command like this:

```shell
atmos terraform workspace delete <component> -s <stack> [workspace-name] [options]
```

This command deletes a Terraform workspace. The workspace must be empty (contain no resources) before it can be deleted. You cannot delete the currently selected workspace.

:::caution
A workspace must be empty before it can be deleted. Use `terraform destroy` to remove all resources first.

:::tip
Run `atmos terraform workspace delete --help` to see all the available options

## Examples

```shell
# Delete a workspace (auto-calculated from stack context)
atmos terraform workspace delete vpc -s dev

# Delete a specific workspace by name
atmos terraform workspace delete vpc -s dev my-workspace

# Force delete a non-empty workspace
atmos terraform workspace delete vpc -s dev my-workspace -force
```

## Arguments

<dl>
    <dt>`component` <em>(required)</em></dt>
    <dd>
        Atmos terraform component.
    </dd>

    <dt>`workspace-name` <em>(optional)</em></dt>
    <dd>
        The name of the workspace to delete. If not provided, Atmos calculates the workspace name from the stack context.

</dl>

## Flags

<dl>
    <dt>`--stack` <em>(alias `-s`)</em> <em>(required)</em></dt>
    <dd>
        Atmos stack.
    </dd>

    <dt>`--dry-run` <em>(optional)</em></dt>
    <dd>
        Show what would be executed without actually running the command.

        ```shell
        atmos terraform workspace delete vpc -s dev --dry-run
        ```
    </dd>

    <dt>`--skip-init` <em>(optional)</em></dt>
    <dd>
        Skip running `terraform init` before executing the command.

    </dd>
</dl>

## Native Terraform Flags

The `atmos terraform workspace delete` command supports native `terraform workspace delete` flags. Pass them directly or use `--` to separate Atmos flags from Terraform flags.

<dl>
    <dt>`-force`</dt>
    <dd>
        Force deletion even if the workspace has resources. Use with caution.

        ```shell
        atmos terraform workspace delete vpc -s dev -force my-workspace
        ```
    </dd>

    <dt>`-lock=true`</dt>
    <dd>
        Lock the state file when locking is supported. Defaults to `true`.

        ```shell
        atmos terraform workspace delete vpc -s dev -lock=false my-workspace
        ```
    </dd>

    <dt>`-lock-timeout=DURATION`</dt>
    <dd>
        Duration to retry a state lock. Defaults to `0s`.

        ```shell
        atmos terraform workspace delete vpc -s dev -lock-timeout=30s my-workspace
        ```
    </dd>
</dl>
