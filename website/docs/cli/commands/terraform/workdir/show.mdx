  Name          dev-vpc
  Component     vpc
  Stack         dev
  Source        components/terraform/vpc

```

## Understanding the Output

The command displays:

- **Name** - The workdir name (format: `<stack>-<component>`)
- **Component** - The Terraform component name
- **Stack** - The stack this workdir belongs to
- **Source** - Original component location
- **Path** - Relative path to the workdir
- **Content Hash** - Hash of the workdir contents (partially masked for security)
- **Created** - Timestamp when the workdir was first created
- **Updated** - Timestamp of the last update

## Error Handling

If the workdir doesn't exist, the command will display an error:

```shell
$ atmos terraform workdir show vpc --stack dev
Error: workdir not found for component 'vpc' in stack 'dev'
```

This typically means:
- The component hasn't been initialized yet (run `atmos terraform init`)
- The workdir was cleaned (run `atmos terraform init` to recreate)
- The `provision.workdir.enabled` setting is not enabled for this component
