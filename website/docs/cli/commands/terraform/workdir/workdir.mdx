<Intro>
Use these commands to manage component workdirs—isolated directories where Terraform commands execute. Workdirs enable concurrent component execution and just-in-time source provisioning.

## Overview

The `workdir` commands help you manage component workdirs. A workdir is an isolated directory created for each component-stack combination, containing:

- A copy of the component source code
- Generated configuration files (varfiles, backend config)
- Terraform state files and provider plugins

This isolation enables:

- **Concurrent execution** - Multiple components can run simultaneously without conflicts
- **Just-in-time provisioning** - Components are fetched and prepared on demand
- **Clean separation** - Each stack's component instance has its own working directory

## Examples

### List All Workdirs

```shell
# List all workdirs in the project
atmos terraform workdir list
```

### Show Workdir Details

```shell
# Show details for a specific component's workdir
atmos terraform workdir show vpc --stack dev
```

### Clean Workdirs

```shell
# Clean all workdirs to free disk space
atmos terraform workdir clean --all

# Clean a specific workdir
atmos terraform workdir clean vpc --stack dev
```

### Describe Workdir Configuration

```shell
# Output workdir config as stack manifest snippet
atmos terraform workdir describe vpc --stack dev
```
