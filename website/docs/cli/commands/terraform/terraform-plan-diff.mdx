# terraform plan-diff

The `atmos terraform plan-diff` command compares two Terraform plans and shows the differences between them.

It takes an original plan file (`--orig`) and optionally a new plan file (`--new`). If the new plan file is not provided, it will generate one by running `terraform plan` with the current configuration.

The command shows differences in variables, resources, and outputs between the two plans.

## Usage

```shell
atmos terraform plan-diff <component> -s <stack> --orig=<original-plan-file> [--new=<new-plan-file>] [options]
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `component` | The name of the component to run the command against |

## Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-s, --stack` | The stack name to use (required) |
| `--orig` | Path to the original Terraform plan file (required) |
| `--new` | Path to the new Terraform plan file (optional) |
| `--skip-init` | Skip running `terraform init` before executing the command |

You can also pass any additional flags and arguments that are supported by the `terraform plan` command when generating a new plan.

## Examples

### Compare an existing plan with a new plan generated with current configuration

```shell
atmos terraform plan-diff myapp -s dev --orig=orig.plan
```

### Compare two existing plan files

```shell
atmos terraform plan-diff myapp -s dev --orig=orig.plan --new=new.plan
```

### Compare an existing plan with a new plan using different variable values

```shell
atmos terraform plan-diff myapp -s dev --orig=orig.plan -var location="New York"
```

## Output Format

When there are no differences between the two plan files:

```text
The planfiles are identical
```

When there are differences between the two plan files:

```text
Diff Output
=========

Variables:
----------
+ added_var: "new value"
- removed_var: "old value"
~ changed_var: "old value" => "new value"

Resources:
-----------
+ aws_s3_bucket.new_bucket
- aws_instance.removed_instance
~ aws_security_group.modified_group
  ~ ingress.cidr_blocks: ["10.0.0.0/16"] => ["10.0.0.0/8"]
  + egress.port: 443

Outputs:
--------
+ new_output: "value"
- removed_output: "value"
~ changed_output: "old" => "new"
```

## Exit Codes

| Exit Code | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 0 | Success - no differences found |
| 1 | Error occurred during execution |
| 2 | Success - differences found between plans |

## Use Cases

The `plan-diff` command is useful for:

1. **Validating changes**: Compare a previously saved plan with the current state to see what has changed.
2. **Reviewing variable impacts**: See how changing variables affects the infrastructure plan.
3. **CI/CD workflows**: Use the exit code to determine if changes are expected or unexpected.
4. **Documentation**: Generate human-readable diffs for change management and approvals.

## How It Works

The command:

1. Runs `terraform init` in the component directory
2. If `--new` is not specified, runs a plan and captures the output
3. Runs `terraform show -json` for each plan to get the JSON representation
4. Sorts the JSON for consistent comparison
5. Creates a diff between the two plans
6. Handles sensitive values properly by displaying `(sensitive value)`
7. Returns appropriate exit code based on whether differences were found
