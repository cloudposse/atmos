:::note Purpose
This command implements the locking feature of [Atmos Pro](https://app.cloudposse.com/docs). Use this command to unlock
a stack in Atmos Pro that has previously been locked by the lock command.
:::

## Usage

Execute the `pro unlock` command like this:

```shell
atmos pro unlock --component <component> --stack <stack>
```

## Description

Atmos pro supports locking a stack in Atmos Pro so that it cannot be planned or applied by another process (pull
request, CI/CD, etc.). Your CI/CD pipeline can use the `atmos pro lock` command to ensure it is the exclusive process
interacting with a stack at the current time. Once your work is complete, you can unlock the stack by running the `atmos
pro unlock` command.

:::tip
Run `atmos pro unlock --help` to see all the available options

## Examples

```shell
atmos pro lock --component vpc --stack plat-ue2-dev --ttl 300
