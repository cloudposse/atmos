:::note Purpose
Use this command to get the Atmos CLI version
:::

<Screengrab title="atmos help" slug="atmos-version" />

## Usage

Execute the `atmos version` command like this:

```shell
atmos version
```

This will show the CLI version. 

From time to time, Atmos will check for updates. The frequency is configured in the `atmos.yaml`. There are two options `daily` and `weekly`. The default is to check `daily`, and if any unsupported values are passed this default will be used.

It is also possible to turn off version checks in `atmos.yaml` by switching `enable` to `false`, or by setting the `ATMOS_VERSION_CHECK_ENABLED` environment variable to `false`, which overriders the config's settings. 

```shell
atmos version --check
```

The version command supports --check flag. 
It will force atmos to check for a new version, irrespective of the configuration settings.
