:::note Purpose
Use this command to get the Atmos CLI version
:::

<Screengrab title="atmos help" slug="atmos-version" />

## Usage

Execute the `atmos version` command like this:

```shell
atmos version
```

This will show the CLI version. 

From time to time, Atmos will check for updates. The frequency of these checks is configured in the `atmos.yaml` file.

Atmos supports three ways to specify the update check frequency:

1. As an integer: Specify the number of seconds between checks (for example, 3600 for hourly checks).
2. As a duration with a suffix: Use a time suffix to indicate the interval (for example, `1m` for one minute, `5h` for five hours, or `2d` for two days).
3. As one of the predefined keywords: Choose from the following options: minute, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly. The default is daily.
The default is to check `daily`, and if any unsupported values are passed this default will be used.

It is also possible to turn off version checks in `atmos.yaml` by setting `version.check.enabled` to `false`,
or by setting the `ATMOS_VERSION_CHECK_ENABLED` environment variable to `false`, which overrides
the `version.check.enabled` settings in `atmos.yaml`.

```shell
atmos version --check
```
