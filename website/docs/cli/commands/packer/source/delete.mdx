## Usage

```shell
atmos packer source delete <component> --stack <stack> --force
```

## Description

The `delete` command removes the vendored component directory. For safety, this command requires the `--force` flag to confirm deletion.

This is useful for:
- Cleaning up vendored components before re-vendoring
- Removing components that are no longer needed
- Resetting to a clean state for troubleshooting

## Examples

### Delete Vendored Component

Remove a vendored component directory:

```shell
atmos packer source delete ami-builder --stack dev --force
```

Output:
```
Deleting directory: components/packer/ami-builder
✓ Successfully deleted: components/packer/ami-builder
```

### Without Force Flag

Attempting to delete without `--force` shows an error:

```shell
atmos packer source delete ami-builder --stack dev
```

Output:
```
Error: --force flag is required

Explanation: Deletion requires --force flag for safety

Hint: Use --force to confirm deletion
```

## Arguments

<dl>
  <dt>`component`</dt>
  <dd>**Required.** The name of the Atmos component to delete.</dd>
</dl>

## Flags

<dl>
  <dt>`--stack` / `-s`</dt>
  <dd>**Required.** The Atmos stack name. Can also be set via `ATMOS_STACK` environment variable.</dd>

  <dt>`--force` / `-f`</dt>
  <dd>**Required.** Confirm deletion. Without this flag, the command fails for safety.</dd>
</dl>

## Safety

The `delete` command has several safety features:

1. **Requires --force** - Prevents accidental deletion
2. **Only deletes source-managed components** - Only works on components with `source` configured
3. **Non-destructive on missing directories** - Shows a warning if the directory doesn't exist instead of failing
