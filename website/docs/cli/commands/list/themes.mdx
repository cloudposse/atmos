```
</Terminal>

## Flags

<dl>
  <dt>`--all`</dt>
  <dd>Show all available themes instead of just recommended ones (default: `false`)</dd>
</dl>

## Configuration

To use a theme, set it in your `atmos.yaml` configuration file:

```yaml
settings:
  terminal:
    theme: "dracula"  # Theme name from the list
```

The theme will be applied to all markdown output, including:
- Command help text
- Error messages
- Documentation output
- Workflow descriptions

## Theme Precedence

When determining which theme to use, Atmos follows this precedence:

1. **Theme setting** - If `settings.terminal.theme` is set, that theme is used
2. **Custom colors** - If no theme is set but custom markdown colors are configured, those are used
3. **Default theme** - If neither theme nor custom colors are set, the "default" theme is used

### Combining Themes with Custom Colors

You can override specific colors of a theme by setting custom markdown colors in your configuration:

```yaml
settings:
  terminal:
    theme: "dracula"
  markdown:
    h1:
      color: "#FF79C6"  # Override H1 color while keeping other theme colors
```

### Dark Themes

- **Dracula** - High contrast dark theme with vibrant colors
- **Catppuccin Mocha** - Modern pastel dark theme, easy on the eyes
