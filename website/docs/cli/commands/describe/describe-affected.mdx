:::note Purpose
Use this command to show a list of the affected Atmos components and stacks given two Git commits.

<Screengrab title="atmos describe affected --help" slug="atmos-describe-affected--help" />

## Description

The command uses two different Git commits to produce a list of affected Atmos components and stacks.

For the first commit, the command assumes that the current repo root is a Git checkout. An error will be thrown if the
current repo is not a Git repository (the `.git/` folder does not exist or is configured incorrectly).

The second commit can be specified on the command line by using
the `--ref` ([Git References](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References)) or `--sha` (commit SHA) flags.
The `--sha` takes precedence over the `--ref` flag.

:::tip
If the flags are not provided, the `ref` will be set automatically to the reference to the default branch
(`refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` Git ref, usually the `main` branch).
:::

## How does it work?

The command performs the following:

- If the `--repo-path` flag is passed, the command uses it as the path to the already cloned target repo with which to
  compare the current working branch. I this case, the command will not clone and checkout the
  target reference, but instead will use the already cloned one to compare the current branch with. In this case, the
  `--ref`, `--sha`, `--ssh-key` and `--ssh-key-password` flags are not used, and an error will be thrown if the `--repo-path`
  flag and any of the `--ref`, `--sha`, `--ssh-key` or `--ssh-key-password` flags are provided at the same time

- Otherwise, if the `--clone-target-ref=true` flag is specified, the command clones (into a temp directory) the remote
  target with which to compare the current working branch. If the `--ref` flag or the commit SHA flag `--sha` are provided,
  the command uses them to clone and checkout the remote target. Otherwise, the `HEAD` of the remote origin is
  used (`refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` Git ref, usually the `main` branch)

- Otherwise, (if the `--repo-path` and `--clone-target-ref=true` flags are not passed), the command does not clone anything
  from the remote origin, but instead just copies the current repo into a temp directory and checks out the target
  reference with which to compare the current working branch.
  If the `--ref` flag or the commit SHA flag `--sha` are
  provided, the command uses them to check out. Otherwise, the `HEAD` of the remote origin is used
  (`refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` Git ref, usually the `main` branch).
  This requires that the target reference is already cloned by Git, and the information about it exists in
  the `.git` directory (in case of using a non-default branch as the target, Git deep clone needs to be executed instead
  of a shallow clone).
  This is the recommended way to execute the `atmos describe affected` command since it allows
  [working with private repositories](#working-with-private-repositories) without providing the SSH credentials
  (`--ssh-key` and `--ssh-key-password` flags), since in this case Atmos does not access the remote origin and instead
  just checks out the target reference (which is already on the local file system)

- The command deep-merges all stack configurations from both sources: the current working branch and the target reference

- The command searches for changes in the component directories

- The command compares each stack manifest section of the stack configurations from both sources looking for differences

- And finally, the command outputs a JSON or YAML document consisting of a list of the affected components and stacks
  and what caused it to be affected

Since Atmos first checks the component folders for changes, if it finds any affected files, it will mark all related
components and stacks as affected. Atmos will then skip evaluating the stacks for differences since it already
knows that they are affected.

## Output

The command outputs a list of objects (in JSON or YAML format).

Each object has the following schema:

```json
{
  "component": "....",
  "component_type": "....",
  "component_path": "....",
  "stack": "....",
  "stack_slug": "....",
  "spacelift_stack": ".....",
  "atlantis_project": ".....",
  "affected": ".....",
  "file": ".....",
  "folder": ".....",
  "dependents": [],
  "included_in_dependents": "true | false"
}
```

where:

- `component` - the affected Atmos component

- `component_type` - the type of the component (`terraform` or `helmfile`)

- `component_path` - the filesystem path to the `terraform` or `helmfile` component

- `stack` - the affected Atmos stack

- `stack_slug` - the Atmos stack slug (concatenation of the Atmos stack and Atmos component)

- `spacelift_stack` - the affected Spacelift stack. It will be included only if the Spacelift workspace is enabled for the Atmos component in the
  Atmos stack in the `settings.spacelift.workspace_enabled` section (either directly in the component's `settings.spacelift.workspace_enabled` section
  or via inheritance)

- `atlantis_project` - the affected Atlantis project name. It will be included only if the Atlantis integration is configured in
  the `settings.atlantis` section in the stack config. Refer to [Atlantis Integration](/integrations/atlantis) for more details

- `file` - if the Atmos component depends on an external file, and the file was changed (see `affected.file` below),
  the `file` attributes shows the modified file

- `folder` - if the Atmos component depends on an external folder, and any file in the folder was changed (see `affected.folder` below),
  the `folder` attributes shows the modified folder

- `dependents` - list of components that depend on the current affected component. It will be included only if the
  command-line flag `--include-dependents=true` is passed (to take dependencies into account) and there are other components
  that depend on the affected component in the stack.
  Refer to [`atmos describe dependents`](/cli/commands/describe/dependents) for more details. The `dependents` property is
  hierarchical - each component in the list will also contain a `dependents` property if that component has dependent
  components as well

- `included_in_dependents` - a boolean flag indicating if the affected component in the stack is also present in any of the `dependents`
  properties of the other affected components. It will be included only if the command-line flag `--include-dependents=true`
  is passed. If `included_in_dependents` is set to `true`, it indicates that the affected component in the stack is also
  present in any of the `dependents` lists in the dependency hierarchy of the other affected components.
  This flag can be used to decide whether to plan/apply the affected component - you might skip planning/applying the component
  since it's also a dependency of another affected component and will be triggered in the dependency order of the other
  affected component

- `affected` - shows what was changed for the component. The possible values are:

  - `stack.vars` - the `vars` component section in the stack config has been modified

  - `stack.env` - the `env` component section in the stack config has been modified

  - `stack.settings` - the `settings` component section in the stack config has been modified

  - `stack.metadata` - the `metadata` component section in the stack config has been modified

  - `component` - the Terraform or Helmfile component that the Atmos component provisions has been changed

  - `component.module` - the Terraform component is affected because it uses a local Terraform module (not from the Terraform registry, but from the
    local filesystem), and that local module has been changed.

    For example, let's suppose that we have a catalog of reusable Terraform modules in the `modules` folder (outside the `components` folder), and
    we have defined the following `label` Terraform module in `modules/label`:

    ```hcl title="modules/label"
      module "label" {
        source  = "cloudposse/label/null"
        version = "0.25.0"
        context = module.this.context
      }

      output "label" {
        value       = module.label
        description = "Label outputs"
      }
    ```

    We then use the Terraform module in the `components/terraform/top-level-component1` component:

    ```hcl title="components/terraform/top-level-component1"
      module "service_2_label" {
        source  = "../../../modules/label"
        context = module.this.context
      }

      output "service_2_id" {
        value       = module.service_2_label.label.id
        description = "Service 2 ID"
      }
    ```

    The `label` module is not in the stack config of the `top-level-component1` component (not in the YAML stack config files), but Atmos
    understands Terraform dependencies (using a Terraform parser from HashiCorp), and can automatically detect any changes to the module.

    For example, if you make changes to any files in the folder `modules/label`, Atmos will detect the module changes, and since the module is a
    Terraform dependency of the `top-level-component1` component, Atmos will mark the component as affected with the `affected` attribute
    set to `component.module`:

    ```json
      [
        {
          "component": "top-level-component1",
          "component_type": "terraform",
          "component_path": "examples/tests/components/terraform/top-level-component1",
          "stack": "tenant1-ue2-staging",
          "stack_slug": "tenant1-ue2-staging-top-level-component1",
          "spacelift_stack": "tenant1-ue2-staging-top-level-component1",
          "atlantis_project": "tenant1-ue2-staging-top-level-component1",
          "affected": "component.module"
        },
        {

      ]
    ```
    <br/>

  - `stack.settings.spacelift.admin_stack_selector` - the Atmos component for the Spacelift admin stack.
    This will be included only if all the following is true:

    - The `atmos describe affected` is executed with the `--include-spacelift-admin-stacks=true` flag

    - Any of the affected Atmos components has configured the section `settings.spacelift.admin_stack_selector` pointing to the Spacelift admin
      stack that manages the components. For example:

      ```yaml title="stacks/orgs/cp/tenant1/_defaults.yaml"
      settings:
        spacelift:
          # All Spacelift child stacks for the `tenant1` tenant are managed by the
          # `tenant1-ue2-prod-infrastructure-tenant1` Spacelift admin stack.
          # The `admin_stack_selector` attribute is used to find the affected Spacelift
          # admin stack for each affected Atmos stack
          # when executing the command
          # `atmos describe affected --include-spacelift-admin-stacks=true`
          admin_stack_selector:
            component: infrastructure-tenant1
            tenant: tenant1
            environment: ue2
            stage: prod
      ```

    - The Spacelift admin stack is enabled by `settings.spacelift.workdpace_enabled` set to `true`. For example:

      ```yaml title="stacks/catalog/terraform/spacelift/infrastructure-tenant1.yaml"
      components:
        terraform:
          infrastructure-tenant1:
            metadata:
              component: spacelift
              inherits:
                - spacelift-defaults
            settings:
              spacelift:
                workspace_enabled: true
      ```

  - `file` - an external file on the local filesystem that the Atmos component depends on was changed.

    Dependencies on external files (not in the component's folder) are defined using the `file` attribute in the `settings.depends_on` map.
    For example:

    ```yaml title="stacks/catalog/terraform/top-level-component3.yaml"
    components:
      terraform:
        top-level-component3:
          metadata:
            component: "top-level-component1"
          settings:
            depends_on:
              1:
                file: "examples/tests/components/terraform/mixins/introspection.mixin.tf"
    ```

    In the configuration above, we specify that the Atmos component `top-level-component3` depends on the file
    `examples/tests/components/terraform/mixins/introspection.mixin.tf` (which is not in the component's folder). If the file gets modified,
    the component `top-level-component3` will be included in the `atmos describe affected` command output. For example:

    ```json
      [
        {
          "component": "top-level-component3",
          "component_type": "terraform",
          "component_path": "components/terraform/top-level-component1",
          "stack": "tenant1-ue2-test-1",
          "stack_slug": "tenant1-ue2-test-1-top-level-component3",
          "atlantis_project": "tenant1-ue2-test-1-top-level-component3",
          "affected": "file",
          "file": "examples/tests/components/terraform/mixins/introspection.mixin.tf"
        }
      ]
    ```

  - `folder` - any file in an external folder that the Atmos component depends on was changed.

    Dependencies on external folders are defined using the `folder` attribute in the `settings.depends_on` map.
    For example:

    ```yaml title="stacks/catalog/terraform/top-level-component3.yaml"
    components:
      terraform:
        top-level-component3:
          metadata:
            component: "top-level-component1"
          settings:
            depends_on:
              1:
                file: "examples/tests/components/terraform/mixins/introspection.mixin.tf"
              2:
                folder: "examples/tests/components/helmfile/infra/infra-server"
    ```

    In the configuration above, we specify that the Atmos component `top-level-component3` depends on the folder
    `examples/tests/components/helmfile/infra/infra-server`. If any file in the folder gets modified,
    the component `top-level-component3` will be included in the `atmos describe affected` command output. For example:

    ```json
      [
        {
          "component": "top-level-component3",
          "component_type": "terraform",
          "component_path": "components/terraform/top-level-component1",
          "stack": "tenant1-ue2-test-1",
          "stack_slug": "tenant1-ue2-test-1-top-level-component3",
          "atlantis_project": "tenant1-ue2-test-1-top-level-component3",
          "affected": "folder",
          "folder": "examples/tests/components/helmfile/infra/infra-server"
        }
      ]
    ```

<br/>

:::note

Abstract Atmos components (where `metadata.type` is set to `abstract`) are not included in the output since they serve
as blueprints for other Atmos components and are not meant to be provisioned.

## Affected Components with Dependencies

The output of the `atmos describe affected` command can include dependencies for the affected components.

If the command-line flag `--include-dependents=true` is passed to the `atmos describe affected` command, and there are
other components that depend on the affected components in the stack, the command will include a `dependents`
property (list) for each affected component. The `dependents` property is hierarchical - each component in the list will
also contain a `dependents` property if that component has dependent components as well.

For example, suppose that we have the following configuration for the Atmos components `component-1`, `component-2` and
`component-3` in the stack `plat-ue2-dev`:

<File title="stacks/orgs/acme/plat/dev/us-east-2.yaml">
  ```yaml
    components:
      terraform:
        component-1:
          metadata:
            component: "terraform-component-1"
          vars: {}

        component-2:
          metadata:
            component: "terraform-component-2"
          vars: {}
          settings:
            depends_on:
              1:
                component: "component-1"

        component-3:
          metadata:
            component: "terraform-component-3"
          vars: {}
          settings:
            depends_on:
              1:
                component: "component-2"
  ```
</File>

<br/>

:::tip
For more details on how to configure component dependencies, refer to [`atmos describe dependents`](/cli/commands/describe/dependents)
:::

<br/>

In the above configuration, `component-3` depends on `component-2`, whereas `component-2` depends on `component-1`.

If all the components are affected (modified) in the current working branch,
the `atmos describe affected --include-dependents=true` command will produce the following result:

<br/>

<Terminal title="atmos describe affected --include-dependents=true">
 ```json
  [
    {
      "component": "component-1",
      "stack": "plat-ue2-dev",
      "stack_slug": "plat-ue2-dev-component-1",
      "included_in_dependents": false,
      "dependents": [
        {
          "component": "component-2",
          "stack": "plat-ue2-dev",
          "stack_slug": "plat-ue2-dev-component-2",
          "dependents": [
            {
              "component": "component-3",
              "stack": "plat-ue2-dev",
              "stack_slug": "plat-ue2-dev-component-3"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "component": "component-2",
      "stack": "plat-ue2-dev",
      "stack_slug": "plat-ue2-dev-component-2",
      "included_in_dependents": true,
      "dependents": [
        {
          "component": "component-3",
          "stack": "plat-ue2-dev",
          "stack_slug": "plat-ue2-dev-component-3"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "component": "component-3",
      "stack": "plat-ue2-dev",
      "stack_slug": "plat-ue2-dev-component-3",
      "included_in_dependents": true
    }
  ]
 ```
</Terminal>

<br/>

The `component-1` component does not depend on any other component, and therefore it has the `included_in_dependents`
attribute set to `false`. The `component-2` and `component-3` components depend on other components and are included in
the `dependents` property of the other components, and hence the `included_in_dependents` attribute is set to `true`.

When processing the above output, you might decide to not plan/apply the `component-2` and `component-3` components
since they are in the `dependents` property of the `component-1` component. Instead, you might just
trigger `component-1` and then `component-2` and `component-3` in the order of dependencies.

## Working with Private Repositories

There are a few ways to work with private repositories with which the current local branch is compared to detect the changed files and affected Atmos
stacks and components:

- Using the `--ssh-key` flag to specify the filesystem path to a PEM-encoded private key to clone private repos using SSH, and
  the `--ssh-key-password` flag to provide the encryption password for the PEM-encoded private key if the key contains a password-encrypted PEM block

- Execute the `atmos describe affected --repo-path <path_to_cloned_target_repo>` command in a [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).
  For this to work, clone the remote private repository using the [checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) GitHub action. Then use
  the `--repo-path` flag to specify the path to the already cloned target repository with which to compare the current branch

- It should just also work with whatever SSH config/context has been already set up, for example, when
  using [SSH agents](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/agent). In this case, you don't need to use the `--ssh-key`, `--ssh-key-password`
  and `--repo-path` flags to clone private repositories

## Using with GitHub Actions

If the `atmos describe affected` command is executed in a [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), and you don't want to store or
generate a long-lived SSH private key on the server, you can do the following (__NOTE:__ This is only required if the action is attempting to clone a
private repo which is not itself):

- Create a GitHub
  [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
  with scope permissions to clone private repos

- Add the created PAT as a repository or GitHub organization [secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets)

- In your GitHub action, clone the remote repository using the [checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) GitHub action

- Execute `atmos describe affected` command with the `--repo-path` flag set to the cloned repository path using
  the [`GITHUB_WORKSPACE`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables) ENV variable (which points to the default working
  directory on the GitHub runner for steps, and the default location of the repository when using the [checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout)
  action). For example:

    ```shell
    atmos describe affected --repo-path $GITHUB_WORKSPACE
    ```
