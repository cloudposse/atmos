:::note Purpose
This command implements [Atmos Vendoring](/core-concepts/vendoring/). Use this command to download sources from local and remote 
repositories for Terraform and Helmfile components and stacks.

With Atmos vendoring, you can copy components and other artifacts from the following sources:

- Copy all files from an [OCI Registry](https://opencontainers.org) into a local folder
- Copy all files from Git, Mercurial, Amazon S3, Google GCP into a local folder
- Copy all files from an HTTP/HTTPS endpoint into a local folder
- Copy a single file from an HTTP/HTTPS endpoint to a local file
- Copy a local file into a local folder (keeping the same file name)
- Copy a local file to a local file with a different file name
- Copy a local folder (all files) into a local folder

## Usage

Execute the `vendor pull` command like this:

```shell
atmos vendor pull
atmos vendor pull --component <component> [options]
atmos vendor pull -c <component> [options]
atmos vendor pull --tags <tag1>,<tag2> [options]
```

## Description

Atmos supports two different ways of vendoring components, stacks and other artifacts:

- Using `component.yaml` vendoring manifest
- Using `vendor.yaml` vendoring manifest

The `component.yaml` vendoring manifest can be used to vendor components from remote repositories.
A `component.yaml` file placed into a component's directory is used to describe the vendoring config for one component only.
Using `component.yaml` is not recommended, and it's maintained for backwards compatibility.

The `vendor.yaml` vendoring manifest provides more functionality than using `component.yaml` files.
It's used to describe vendoring config for all components, stacks and other artifacts for the entire infrastructure.
The file is placed into the directory from which the `atmos vendor pull` command is executed. It's the recommended way to describe vendoring
configurations.

## Vendoring using `vendor.yaml` manifest

- The `vendor.yaml` vendoring manifest supports Kubernetes-style YAML config to describe vendoring configuration for components, stacks,
  and other artifacts.

- The `source` attribute supports all protocols (local files, Git, Mercurial, HTTP, HTTPS, Amazon S3, Google GCP), and all URL and
  archive formats as described in [go-getter](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter), and also the `oci://` scheme to download artifacts from
  [OCI registries](https://opencontainers.org).

- The `targets` in the `sources` support absolute paths and relative paths (relative to the `vendor.yaml` file). Note: if the `targets` paths
  are set as relative, and if the `vendor.yaml` file is detected by Atmos using the `base_path` setting in `atmos.yaml`, the `targets` paths
  will be considered relative to the `base_path`. Multiple targets can be specified.

- `included_paths` and `excluded_paths` support [POSIX-style greedy Globs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) for filenames/paths
  (double-star/globstar `**` is supported as well).

- The `tags` in each source specifies a list of tags to apply to the component. This allows you to only vendor the components that have the
  specified tags by executing a command `atmos vendor pull --tags <tag1>,<tag2>`

## Vendoring using `component.yaml` manifest

- The `component.yaml` vendoring manifest supports Kubernetes-style YAML config to describe component vendoring configuration.
  The file is placed into the component's folder.

- The URIs (`uri`) in `component.yaml` support all protocols (local files, Git, Mercurial, HTTP, HTTPS, Amazon S3, Google GCP), and all URL and
  archive formats as described in [go-getter](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter), and also the `oci://` scheme to download artifacts from
  [OCI registries](https://opencontainers.org).

- `included_paths` and `excluded_paths` in `component.yaml` support [POSIX-style greedy Globs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) for
  file names/paths (double-star/globstar `**` is supported as well).

## Vendoring from OCI Registries

The following config can be used to download the `vpc` component from an AWS public ECR registry:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: atmos/v1
  kind: ComponentVendorConfig
  metadata:
    name: vpc-vendor-config
    description: Config for vendoring of 'vpc' component
  spec:
    source:
      # Download the component from the AWS public ECR registry (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/public/public-registries.html)
      uri: "oci://public.ecr.aws/cloudposse/components/terraform/stable/aws/vpc:{{.Version}}"
      version: "latest"
  ```

<br/>

:::tip
Run `atmos vendor pull --help` to see all the available options
:::

## Examples

```shell
atmos vendor pull
atmos vendor pull --component vpc
atmos vendor pull -c vpc-flow-logs-bucket
atmos vendor pull -c echo-server --type helmfile
atmos vendor pull --tags dev,test
atmos vendor pull --tags networking --dry-run
```

<br/>

:::note

When executing the `atmos vendor pull` command, Atmos performs the following steps to decide which vendoring manifest to use:

- If `vendor.yaml` manifest is found (in the directory from which the command is executed), Atmos will parse the file and execute the command
  against it. If the flag `--component` is not specified, Atmos will vendor all the artifacts defined in the `vendor.yaml` manifest.
  If the flag `--component` is passed in, Atmos will vendor only that component

- If `vendor.yaml` is not found, Atmos will look for the `component.yaml` manifest in the component's folder. If `component.yaml` is not found,
  an error will be thrown. The flag `--component` is required in this case
