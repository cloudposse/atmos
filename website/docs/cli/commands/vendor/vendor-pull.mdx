<Screengrab title="atmos vendor pull --help" slug="atmos-vendor-pull--help" />

With Atmos vendoring, you can copy components and other artifacts from the following sources:

- Copy all files from an [OCI Registry](https://opencontainers.org) into a local folder
- Copy all files from Git, Mercurial, Amazon S3, Google GCP into a local folder
- Copy all files from an HTTP/HTTPS endpoint into a local folder
- Copy a single file from an HTTP/HTTPS endpoint to a local file
- Copy a local file into a local folder (keeping the same file name)
- Copy a local file to a local file with a different file name
- Copy a local folder (all files) into a local folder

## Usage

Execute the `vendor pull` command like this:

```shell
atmos vendor pull 
atmos vendor pull --everything
atmos vendor pull --component <component> [options]
atmos vendor pull -c <component> [options]
atmos vendor pull --tags <tag1>,<tag2> [options]
```

## Description

Atmos supports two different ways of vendoring components, stacks and other artifacts:

- Using `component.yaml` vendoring manifest
- Using `vendor.yaml` vendoring manifest

The `component.yaml` vendoring manifest can be used to vendor components from remote repositories.
A `component.yaml` file placed into a component's directory is used to describe the vendoring config for one component only.
Using `component.yaml` is not recommended, and it's maintained for backwards compatibility.

The `vendor.yaml` vendoring manifest provides more functionality than using `component.yaml` files.
It's used to describe vendoring config for all components, stacks and other artifacts for the entire infrastructure.
The file is placed into the directory from which the `atmos vendor pull` command is executed. It's the recommended way to describe vendoring
configurations.

## Vendoring using `vendor.yaml` manifest

- The `vendor.yaml` vendoring manifest supports Kubernetes-style YAML config to describe vendoring configuration for components, stacks,
  and other artifacts.

- The `source` attribute supports all protocols (local files, Git, Mercurial, HTTP, HTTPS, Amazon S3, Google GCP), and all URL and
  archive formats as described in [go-getter](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter), and also the `oci://` scheme to download artifacts from
  [OCI registries](https://opencontainers.org).

- The `targets` in the `sources` support absolute paths and relative paths (relative to the `vendor.yaml` file). Note: if the `targets` paths
  are set as relative, and if the `vendor.yaml` file is detected by Atmos using the `base_path` setting in `atmos.yaml`, the `targets` paths
  will be considered relative to the `base_path`. Multiple targets can be specified.

- `included_paths` and `excluded_paths` support [POSIX-style greedy Globs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) for filenames/paths
  (double-star/globstar `**` is supported as well).

- The `tags` in each source specifies a list of tags to apply to the component. This allows you to only vendor the components that have the
  specified tags by executing a command `atmos vendor pull --tags <tag1>,<tag2>`

## Vendoring using `component.yaml` manifest

- The `component.yaml` vendoring manifest supports Kubernetes-style YAML config to describe component vendoring configuration.
  The file is placed into the component's folder.

- The URIs (`uri`) in `component.yaml` support all protocols (local files, Git, Mercurial, HTTP, HTTPS, Amazon S3, Google GCP), and all URL and
  archive formats as described in [go-getter](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter), and also the `oci://` scheme to download artifacts from
  [OCI registries](https://opencontainers.org).

- `included_paths` and `excluded_paths` in `component.yaml` support [POSIX-style greedy Globs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) for
  file names/paths (double-star/globstar `**` is supported as well).

## Vendoring from OCI Registries

The following config can be used to download the `vpc` component from an AWS public ECR registry:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: atmos/v1
  kind: ComponentVendorConfig
  metadata:
    name: vpc-vendor-config
    description: Config for vendoring of 'vpc' component
  spec:
    source:
      # Download the component from the AWS public ECR registry (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/public/public-registries.html)
      uri: "oci://public.ecr.aws/cloudposse/components/terraform/stable/aws/vpc:{{.Version}}"
      version: "latest"
  ```

## Vendoring from SSH

This is the most common way to access non-public Git repositories from automated systems because it allows access to private repositories without interactive prompts.
Atmos will use any installed SSH keys automatically. There are two primary ways to specify an SSH source:

### SCP-style Sources

Atmos supports traditional SCP-style sources, which use a colon to separate the host from the repository, like this:

```shell
git::git@github.com:cloudposse/terraform-null-label.git?ref={{.Version}}
```

Atmos rewrites this URL to the following format:

```shell
git::ssh://git@github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label.git?depth=1&ref={{.Version}}
```

If no username is supplied and the host is `github.com`, Atmos automatically injects the default username `git`.

### Explicit SSH

When the SSH scheme (`ssh://`) is explicitly specified, the URL is used as provided. In this scenario, no rewriting occurs because the URL already includes the explicit `ssh://` scheme. For example:

```shell
git::ssh://git@github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label.git?ref={{ .Version }}
```

the URL is used as provided. In this scenario, no rewriting occurs because the URL already includes an explicit `ssh://` schema.

### Important Notes

- A URL like:
  ```shell
  github.com:cloudposse/terraform-null-label.git?ref={{ .Version }}
  ```
  is **not valid** because go-getter misinterprets **github.com:** as a schema and will error out.

- A URL without any scheme, such as:
  ```shell
  github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label.git?ref={{ .Version }}
  ```
  defaults to HTTPS and triggers Atmos to inject credentials if available.  

## HTTPS Vendoring

Atmos supports vendoring components using HTTPS URLs. 

For example:
```
github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label.git?ref={{ .Version }}
```
is automatically resolved as:
```
git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label.git?depth=1&ref={{ .Version }}
```

## Authentication & Token Usage for HTTPS

Atmos prioritizes authentication credentials based on predefined environment variables. The priority order for each provider is:

### GitHub
| Environment Variable           | Purpose                                                                                                  |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ATMOS_GITHUB_TOKEN             | Bearer token for GitHub API requests, enabling authentication for private repositories and higher rate limits. |
| GITHUB_TOKEN                   | Used as a fallback if ATMOS_GITHUB_TOKEN is not set.                                                    |

**Default Username for HTTPS:** `"x-access-token"`

### Bitbucket
| Environment Variable            | Purpose                                                                                              |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ATMOS_BITBUCKET_TOKEN           | Bitbucket app password for API requests; used to avoid rate limits. When both ATMOS_BITBUCKET_TOKEN and BITBUCKET_TOKEN are defined, the former prevails. |
| BITBUCKET_TOKEN                 | Used as a fallback when ATMOS_BITBUCKET_TOKEN is not set.                                           |
| ATMOS_BITBUCKET_USERNAME        | Bitbucket username for authentication. Takes precedence over BITBUCKET_USERNAME.                    |
| BITBUCKET_USERNAME              | Used as a fallback when ATMOS_BITBUCKET_USERNAME is not set. Bitbucket requires a valid username and does not accept dummy values like `"x-access-token"`. |

**Default Username for HTTPS:** 
- If `ATMOS_BITBUCKET_USERNAME` is set, it is used.
- Otherwise, if `BITBUCKET_USERNAME` is set, it is used.
- If neither is set, `"x-token-auth"` is used.

### GitLab
| Environment Variable            | Purpose                                                                                              |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ATMOS_GITLAB_TOKEN              | Personal Access Token (PAT) for GitLab authentication. Takes precedence over GITLAB_TOKEN.           |
| GITLAB_TOKEN                    | Used as a fallback if ATMOS_GITLAB_TOKEN is not set.                                                 |

**Default Username for HTTPS:** `"oauth2"`

## How HTTPS URLs Are Resolved

When resolving Git sources, Atmos follows these rules:

1. If a **full HTTPS URL** is provided (`git::https://github.com/...`), it is used as-is. No token data is injected, even if environment variables are set.
2. If a **repository name** is provided without a scheme (`github.com/org/repo.git`), it defaults to `https://`, and if a token is set, it is injected into the URL.
3. If a **username and repository name** are provided in SCP format (`git@github.com:org/repo.git`), it is rewritten as an SSH URL.

## Examples

```shell
atmos vendor pull 
atmos vendor pull --everything
atmos vendor pull --component vpc
atmos vendor pull -c vpc-flow-logs-bucket
atmos vendor pull -c echo-server --type helmfile
atmos vendor pull --tags dev,test
atmos vendor pull --tags networking --dry-run
```

:::note

When executing the `atmos vendor pull` command, Atmos performs the following steps to decide which vendoring manifest to use:

- If `vendor.yaml` manifest is found (in the directory from which the command is executed), Atmos will parse the file and execute the command
  against it. If the flag `--component` is not specified, Atmos will vendor all the artifacts defined in the `vendor.yaml` manifest.
  If the flag `--component` is passed in, Atmos will vendor only that component

- If `vendor.yaml` is not found, Atmos will look for the `component.yaml` manifest in the component's folder. If `component.yaml` is not found,
  an error will be thrown. The flag `--component` is required in this case
