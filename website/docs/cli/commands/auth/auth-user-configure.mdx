:::note Purpose
Use this command whenever an identity is backed by a **user** credential source and you need to configure those credentials interactively. The values are stored securely in your OS keychain and can be referenced by other `atmos auth` commands (`login`, `env`, `exec`).
:::

<Note>Currently, only **AWS IAM users** (`kind: aws/user`) are supported. In that case, youâ€™ll be prompted for the AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, and an optional MFA ARN, which will be stored securely.</Note>

## Usage

```shell
atmos auth user configure
```

## Description

- Prompts for `AWS Access Key ID`, `AWS Secret Access Key`, and optional `AWS User MFA ARN`.
- Stores credentials securely in the OS keychain using an alias matching the selected `aws/user` identity name.
- Only identities with `kind: aws/user` are selectable.

## Examples

```shell
# Configure credentials for an aws/user identity
atmos auth user configure
```

## Notes

- Learn how to [configure an `aws/user` identity](/cli/commands/auth/usage#aws-user-break-glass) in `atmos.yaml` before running this.
