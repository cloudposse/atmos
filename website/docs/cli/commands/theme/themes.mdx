## Using a Theme

Once you've found a theme you like, you can use it in two ways:

### Environment Variable

Set the `ATMOS_THEME` environment variable:

```shell
export ATMOS_THEME=dracula
atmos terraform plan
```

### Configuration File

Add the theme to your `atmos.yaml`:

```yaml
settings:
  terminal:
    theme: dracula
```

## Search Tips

The search is flexible and matches against multiple fields:

- **Theme name**: Try "dracula", "solarized", or "github"
- **Theme type**: Search "dark" or "light" to filter by terminal type
- **Author credits**: Find themes by their original creators
- **Color values**: Search for specific hex colors like "#ff0000"
- **Combined terms**: Search "dracula light" to find light variants
