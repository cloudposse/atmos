# Browse Available Themes

Explore the complete collection of terminal themes available for Atmos. Use the search bar to find themes by name, type (dark/light), author, or even specific colors.

## Search Tips

The search is flexible and matches against multiple fields:

- **Theme name**: Try "dracula", "solarized", or "github"
- **Theme type**: Search "dark" or "light" to filter by terminal type
- **Author credits**: Find themes by their original creators
- **Color values**: Search for specific hex colors like "#ff0000"
- **Combined terms**: Search "dracula light" to find light variants
