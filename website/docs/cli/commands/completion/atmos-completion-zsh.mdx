## Zsh Completion Setup

To enable tab completion for Atmos in `Zsh`, add the following to your `~/.zshrc`:

```zsh
# Initialize Zsh completion system
autoload -Uz compinit && compinit

# Enable Atmos CLI completion
source <(atmos completion zsh)

# Improve completion behavior
zstyle ':completion:*' menu select      # Enable menu selection
zstyle ':completion:*' force-list always # Force vertical menu listing

# Ensure the Tab key triggers autocompletion
bindkey '\t' expand-or-complete
```

After saving the file, apply the changes by running:

```zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now, pressing `<Tab>` after atmos will display available subcommands.

If completions do not work, try regenerating the completion cache:

```zsh
rm -f ~/.zcompdump; compinit
```
