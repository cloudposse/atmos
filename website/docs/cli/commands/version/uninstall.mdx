<Intro>
    Uninstall a specific version or all installed versions of Atmos.
</Intro>

## Usage

Execute the `version uninstall` command like this:

```shell
atmos version uninstall [version]
```

This command removes installed versions of Atmos from `~/.atmos/bin/cloudposse/atmos/`.

## Arguments

<dl>
    <dt>`version` <em>(optional)</em></dt>
    <dd>The version to uninstall. If not provided, uninstalls all installed versions of Atmos.</dd>
</dl>

## Examples

Uninstall a specific version:

<CodeBlock language="shell">atmos version uninstall <LatestRelease /></CodeBlock>

Uninstall all installed versions:

```shell
atmos version uninstall
```

## How It Works

The `version uninstall` command is a convenience wrapper around the Atmos toolchain uninstaller:

```shell
# These are equivalent:
atmos version uninstall 1.160.0
atmos toolchain uninstall atmos@1.160.0
```

When uninstalling, the version directory is removed from:

```
~/.atmos/bin/cloudposse/atmos/<version>/
```

## Use Cases

### Clean Up Old Versions

Remove versions you no longer need:

```shell
# Check what's installed
atmos version installed

# Remove old versions
atmos version uninstall 1.150.0
atmos version uninstall 1.155.0
```

### Fresh Start

Remove all installed versions and start fresh:

```shell
atmos version uninstall
```

### Disk Space Recovery

If you have many versions installed and need to free up disk space:

```shell
# List installed versions
atmos version installed

# Remove versions you don't need
atmos version uninstall 1.140.0
```
