<Intro>
Atmos collects **anonymous telemetry** to help improve the product by understanding how it's used. 
This data helps us identify which features are most valuable and where we can make improvements.

- **Error Reports**: Captures anonymized error messages and exit codes to help identify and fix issues  
- **System Details**: Includes OS, CPU architecture, Atmos version, and other diagnostic metadata

### Atmos Pro Users

If you're using [**Atmos Pro**](https://atmos-pro.com), Atmos includes your **Workspace ID** with telemetry. This allows us to associate usage with your account and better support your team by understanding adoption and usage patterns.

### How Telemetry Works

Telemetry data is collected locally and sent securely to [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) analytics service. The data is:

- **Anonymous**: No personally identifiable information is included
- **Secure**: Transmitted over HTTPS with encryption
- **Minimal**: Only essential usage data is collected
- **Transparent**: You can see exactly what's being collected

### Opting Out of Telemetry

You can disable telemetry collection in any of the following ways:

Add the following to your `atmos.yaml` configuration file:

<File title="atmos.yaml">
```yaml
settings:
  telemetry:
    enabled: false
```
</File>

or set environment variable `ATMOS_TELEMETRY_ENABLED` to `false` 

### Collect your own telemetry

You can switch telemery to your own [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) account:

Add the following to your `atmos.yaml` configuration file:

<File title="atmos.yaml">
```yaml
settings:
  telemetry:
    enabled: true
    token: {provide your posthog token}
    endpoint: {provide your posthog endpoint}
```
</File>

or set environment variables `ATMOS_TELEMETRY_TOKEN` and `ATMOS_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT` to your own values
