<Intro>
With the greater adoption of Terraform and DevOps principles, Developers are now using Terraform daily. They decide to use the same patterns for deploying applications with Terraform.
</Intro>

Only Terraform is exceptionally different from deploying containerized apps. There are no rollbacks. It's more akin to performing database migrations without transactions (YOLO!). It's a scary business. Controls are needed.

1. Developers stick their scripts in a CI/CD pipeline with hardcoded credentials set in the environment variables.
2. Pipeline posts comments for each commit on every PR containing the raw output of the `terraform plan`, to validate what *should* happen during `terraform apply`.
3. On merge to main, `terraform apply` is run *without* a planfile. 🤞

:::warning New Problems
- _Still using Jenkins? 🧌🔥_
- CI/CD system promoted to *God Mode*. 🤞 Static administrative cloud credentials are exposed as environment variables, ripe for exfiltration
- No visibility into the impact of the changes across multiple environments at the same time
<details>
<summary>And then there's...</summary>
- No recourse for when a `terraform apply` fails
- Inadequate security mechanisms create a critical risk of catastrophic business loss
- Lack of plan file storage means incorrect implementation of plan/apply workflows
- Missing project-level locks, so PRs can easily clobber each other, rolling back state.
- The entire organization is spammed by GitHub comments every time someone pushes a commit, and a plan is run on the PR
- Automated drift detection is still missing, so you have no idea if what is in `main` is actually deployed
</details>

## Realization

So, it turns out that implementing CI/CD was not as straightforward as developers thought.
It was not as easy as deploying a container that could be easily rolled back. It's more like performing
database migrations without transactions. That's a scary business, and controls are needed.

Developers have [hit a wall](/intro/why-atmos/stage-10) and realize they [need a better way to manage their Terraform code](/intro/why-atmos/nirvana).
