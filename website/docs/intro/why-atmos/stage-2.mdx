<Intro>
As developers grow more comfortable with Terraform, they often transition to a more ambitious approach of automating everything. This results in creating a monolithic "root module," also known as a [Terralith](/terms/terralith).
</Intro>

This stage is characterized by an expansive,
all-encompassing Terraform configuration that attempts to manage every aspect of the infrastructure within a single module.

1. Developers begin by composing a single root module that continuously expands.
2. Define all environments as code (dev, staging, production) within the single Terraform root module.
3. Extensive use of feature flags for everything (e.g. `prod_cluster_size`, `staging_cluster_size`, etc.)

:::warning New Problems
1. Massive blast radius for every change
2. Brittle and prolonged plan/apply cycles
3. Large root modules become more complicated
4. Far from DRY with significant code duplication
5. Testing every parameter combination is impossible
6. No practical way to separate responsibilities
:::

After a while, it becomes scary to apply the changes because, literally, anything can go wrong. Deployments are often interrupted by transient errors,
expiring credentials, and API rate limits that require frequent and manual retries. To get around these problems or as a workaround
for cycles, developers perform targeted applies (e.g. `terraform apply -target`), which is an anti-pattern.
Unfortunately, it will take developers a few more stages of toil [to realize the inefficiencies of this approach (stage 5)](/intro/why-atmos/stage-5).

## Realization

When developers first started using Terraform, they didn’t appreciate the purpose behind modules.
Everything seemed easy enough; just using plain resources worked. However, as the codebase grew, the need for structure and organization became clear. Now, it all makes sense, and developers commit to writing [everything new as a module](/intro/why-atmos/stage-3).
