# Get Started

<Intro>
If you've been using Terraform for a while, you've probably noticed something: what started as a few simple configurations has grown into something much harder to manage. Environments multiply. Copy-paste becomes the norm. Changes feel risky. This is the natural evolution of infrastructure as code—and Atmos is designed to help.
</Intro>

You're not alone. Every team using Terraform goes through this progression. It's normal, expected, and part of the learning process.

The good news? **You don't have to figure it out on your own.** Atmos gives you proven patterns from day one, so you can skip the painful parts and get straight to managing infrastructure with confidence.

## What is Atmos?

Atmos is a framework for Terraform that separates your configuration from your code. You write your Terraform once, then configure it for any environment using simple YAML files.

```mermaid

    subgraph Components ["Components (Terraform)"]
        C1[VPC]
        C2[Kubernetes]
        C3[Database]
    end

    subgraph Stacks ["Stacks (YAML Config)"]
        S1[dev.yaml]
        S2[staging.yaml]
        S3[prod.yaml]
    end

    subgraph Deploy ["Deployments"]
        D1["VPC + K8s + DB<br/>us-east-1/dev"]
        D2["VPC + K8s + DB<br/>us-west-2/staging"]
        D3["VPC + K8s + DB<br/>eu-west-1/prod"]
    end

    C1 --> S1
    C1 --> S2
    C1 --> S3
    C2 --> S1
    C2 --> S2
    C2 --> S3
    C3 --> S1
    C3 --> S2
    C3 --> S3
    S1 --> D1
    S2 --> D2
    S3 --> D3
```

**Components** are your Terraform root modules—reusable building blocks that you write once.

**Stacks** are YAML configuration files that tell Atmos how to deploy those components for each environment.

**Deployments** are the result: your infrastructure running in dev, staging, prod, or anywhere else you need it.

This separation means you can manage dozens of environments without duplicating code. Add a new region? Create a new stack file. Need different settings for production? Override just what's different.

## Core Concepts

Atmos is built around a few key ideas that make scaling Terraform manageable:

### <StepNumber step="1">Write Your Terraform Once</StepNumber>

Instead of copying Terraform code for each environment, you create reusable **components**. A component is just a Terraform root module designed to be configured through variables.

### <StepNumber step="2">Configure Without Code</StepNumber>

**Stacks** let you configure your components using YAML instead of HCL. No code generation, no templates—just clean configuration files that are easy to read, review, and version control.

### <StepNumber step="3">Inherit and Override</StepNumber>

Stacks support **imports and inheritance**, so you can define common settings once and override only what's different. Your production stack might inherit 90% of its configuration from a base, with just a few environment-specific values changed.

### <StepNumber step="4">Keep State Separate</StepNumber>

Each component maintains its own Terraform state. This means smaller blast radius, faster plans, and the ability for different teams to own different parts of your infrastructure.


## What Atmos is Not

You might be wondering what Atmos replaces—or doesn't. Here's the short version:

**Atmos is not a Terraform replacement.** It's a companion. Under the hood, Atmos still runs `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`. You're writing real Terraform, and you keep all of Terraform's power and ecosystem.

**Atmos is not a wrapper that hides Terraform.** You'll see exactly what Terraform commands are being run. There's no magic—just better organization.

**Atmos is not opinionated about your cloud architecture.** Bring your own patterns, or use our [design patterns](/design-patterns/). Atmos helps you manage configuration, not dictate how your infrastructure should look.

**Atmos is not a CI/CD replacement.** It complements your existing pipelines. We provide [GitHub Actions](/integrations/github-actions) and support for other [CI/CD integrations](/integrations/).
