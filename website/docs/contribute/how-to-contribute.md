## Contributing Etiquette

Please see the [Contributor Code of Conduct](/contribute/coc) for information on the rules of conduct.

## Creating an Issue

- It is required that you clearly describe the steps necessary to reproduce the issue you are running into. Although we would love to help our users
  as much as possible, diagnosing issues without clear reproduction steps is extremely time-consuming and simply not sustainable.

- The issue list of the [atmos](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos) repository is exclusively for bug reports and feature requests. Non-conforming
  issues will be closed immediately.

- Issues with no clear steps to reproduce will not be triaged. If an issue is labeled with "needs: reply" and receives no further replies from the
  author of the issue for more than 14 days, it will be closed.

- If you think you have found a bug, or have a new feature idea, please start by making sure it hasn't already
  been [reported](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue). You can search through existing issues to see if there is a
  similar one reported. Include closed issues as it may have been closed with a solution.

- Next, [create a new issue](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/issues/new/choose) that thoroughly explains the problem. Please fill out the
  populated issue form before submitting the issue.

## Creating a Good Code Reproduction

### What is a Code Reproduction?

A code reproduction is a small application that demonstrates a particular issue. The code reproduction should contain the minimum amount of code needed to reproduce the issue and should focus on a single issue.

### Why Should You Create a Reproduction?

A code reproduction of the issue you are experiencing helps us better isolate the cause of the problem. This is an important first step to getting any bug fixed!

Without a reliable code reproduction, it is unlikely we will be able to resolve the issue, leading to it being closed. In other words, creating a code reproduction of the issue helps us help you.

## Creating a Pull Request

- We appreciate you taking the time to contribute! Before submitting a pull request, we ask that you please [create an issue](#creating-an-issue) explaining the bug or feature request and let us know that you plan on making a pull request. If an issue already exists, please comment on that issue letting us know you would like to submit a pull request for it. This helps us to keep track of the pull request and make sure there isn't duplicated effort.

- Looking for an issue to fix? Make sure to look through our issues with the [help wanted](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) label!
