Atmos defines "Stage" as a classification for different lifecycles in infrastructure management, such as Development, Production, Staging, QA, etc. It is recommended to allocate at least one account per stage to maintain clear boundaries and management practices. It's worth noting that the term "Environment" is frequently used in many organizations to describe what Atmos refers to as "Stage."
