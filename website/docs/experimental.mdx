# Experimental Features

<Intro>
Experimental features in Atmos are new capabilities on the path to becoming stable. They are under active development and being refined based on community feedback. While APIs may change, experimental features are intended to graduate to stable—removal would only occur in extreme circumstances.
</Intro>

## What "Experimental" Means

Features marked as experimental:

- **May not be fully functional** - Some documented functionality may not yet be implemented
- **Are under active development** - Features are being refined and validated through community feedback
- **May have breaking changes** - APIs or behavior might change without following semantic versioning guarantees
- **May not have undergone extensive QA** - Testing coverage may be limited, and edge cases may not be fully addressed
- **Are not recommended for critical production workflows** - Use at your own risk until they graduate to stable

When the experimental annotation is removed, all documented functionality will be fully implemented and the feature will be considered stable.

## We Need Your Help

Experimental features rely on community feedback to mature into stable, production-ready capabilities. Your real-world testing and input are invaluable—you help us identify edge cases, improve usability, and prioritize what matters most.

**Ways to contribute:**

1. **Try experimental features** - Use them in non-critical workflows and share what works and what doesn't
2. **Report issues** - File bugs or unexpected behavior via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/issues)
3. **Share feedback** - Discuss your experiences in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/cloudposse/discussions)
4. **Join the conversation** - Connect with us on [Slack](https://slack.cloudposse.com) for real-time discussions

## Graduation Criteria

Experimental features graduate to stable when:

- All documented functionality is fully implemented
- The API has been validated through real-world usage
- Community feedback has been incorporated
- Breaking changes are no longer expected

## Current Experimental Features

The following features are currently marked as experimental. This list is automatically generated from our [roadmap](/roadmap).
