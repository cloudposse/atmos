# Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of the Ionic project, we pledge to respect everyone who contributes by posting issues, updating documentation,
submitting pull requests, providing feedback in comments, and any other activities.

Communication through any of Ionic's channels (GitHub, Slack, Forum, IRC, mailing lists, Twitter, etc.) must be constructive and never resort to
personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

We promise to extend courtesy and respect to everyone involved in this project regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability,
age, race, ethnicity, religion, or level of experience. We expect anyone contributing to the Ionic project to do the same.

If any member of the community violates this code of conduct, the maintainers of the Ionic project may take action, removing issues, comments, and PRs
or blocking accounts as deemed appropriate.
