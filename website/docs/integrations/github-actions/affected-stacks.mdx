<Intro>
The [Atmos Affected Stacks GitHub Action](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-atmos-affected-stacks) makes it easy to identify the affected [atmos stacks](/learn/stacks/) for a pull request. Use it to build a matrix so you can run other actions based on what was affected.
</Intro>

This GitHub Action installs Atmos, then runs [`atmos describe affected`](/cli/commands/describe/affected), and outputs a comprehensive list of affected stacks, both as raw output and as a matrix to be used in subsequent GitHub action jobs.

Discover more details, including the full list of `inputs` and `outputs`, in the [GitHub Action repository](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-atmos-affected-stacks) on GitHub.

## How it works

The [`describe affected`](/cli/commands/describe/affected) command works by comparing two different Git commits to generate a list of affected Atmos components and stacks. It assumes that the current repo root is a Git checkout and accepts a parameter to specify the second commit.

Overall Process:
1.  Clone the target branch (`--ref`), check out the commit, or use the pre-cloned target repository
2.  Deep merge all stack configurations for the current working and remote target branches.
3.  Identify changes in the component directories.
4.  Compare each section of the stack configuration to detect differences.
5.  Output a matrix containing a list of affected components and stacks

Atmos checks component folders for changes first, marking all related components and stacks as affected when changes are detected. It then skips evaluating those stacks for differences, streamlining the process.

### Deleted Component Detection

The `describe affected` command also detects components and stacks that have been deleted in the current branch compared to the target branch. This enables CI/CD pipelines to trigger `terraform destroy` workflows for removed infrastructure.

Deleted components are marked with:
- `deleted: true` - Indicates the component was removed
- `deletion_type: component` or `deletion_type: stack` - Specifies whether just the component or the entire stack was deleted

You can filter the matrix output to separate apply and destroy workflows:

```yaml
jobs:
  detect-changes:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      modified: ${{ steps.affected.outputs.modified }}
      deleted: ${{ steps.affected.outputs.deleted }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Detect affected
        id: affected
        run: |
          atmos describe affected --format json > affected.json

          # Separate modified and deleted components
          jq '[.[] | select(.deleted != true)]' affected.json > modified.json
          jq '[.[] | select(.deleted == true)]' affected.json > deleted.json

          echo "modified=$(cat modified.json | jq -c)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          echo "deleted=$(cat deleted.json | jq -c)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

  apply:
    needs: detect-changes
    if: needs.detect-changes.outputs.modified != '[]'
    strategy:
      matrix:
        include: ${{ fromJson(needs.detect-changes.outputs.modified) }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: cloudposse/github-action-setup-atmos@v2
      - run: atmos terraform apply ${{ matrix.component }} -s ${{ matrix.stack }}

  destroy:
    needs: detect-changes
    if: needs.detect-changes.outputs.deleted != '[]'
    environment: destroy-approval  # Requires manual approval via GitHub Environment protection rules
    strategy:
      matrix:
        include: ${{ fromJson(needs.detect-changes.outputs.deleted) }}
    steps:
      # IMPORTANT: Check out the BASE branch (target branch), not HEAD.
      # The deleted component's configuration only exists in BASE.
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.base_ref }}
      - uses: cloudposse/github-action-setup-atmos@v2
      - run: atmos terraform destroy ${{ matrix.component }} -s ${{ matrix.stack }} --auto-approve
```

:::warning Destroy Operations Require Approval
The example above uses `environment: destroy-approval` to require manual approval before destroying resources.
You must [configure the environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#environment-protection-rules)
in your repository settings with required reviewers. The `--auto-approve` flag is used because approval
happens at the GitHub Actions level, not at the Terraform prompt.

**Important:** The destroy job must check out the **BASE branch** (target branch) rather than HEAD because
`terraform destroy` needs access to the component's stack configuration, which only exists in BASE.
