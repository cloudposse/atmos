**Efficient Automation for Component Updates**

Use Cloud Posse's GitHub Action for updating [Atmos components](/core-concepts/components/) (e.g. [like the ones provided by Cloud Posse](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/)) to streamline your infrastructure management.

Keep your infrastructure repositories current with the latest versions of components using the [Cloud Posse GitHub Actions for Updating Atmos Components](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-atmos-component-updater). This powerful action simplifies and accelerates the management of component updates using pull requests, ensuring that updates are processed quickly, accurately, and without hassle.

With its customizable features, you can design an automated workflow tailored to your needs, making infrastructure repository maintenance more efficient and less error-prone.

## Key Features:

- **Selective Component Processing:** Configure the action to `exclude` or `include` specific components using wildcards, ensuring that only relevant updates are processed.
- **PR Management:** Limit the number of PRs opened at a time, making it easier to manage large-scale updates without overwhelming the system. Automatically close old component-update PRs, so they don't pile up.
- **Material Changes Focus:** Automatically open pull requests only for components with significant changes, skipping minor updates to `component.yaml` files to reduce unnecessary PRs and maintain a streamlined system.
- **Informative PRs:** Link PRs to release notes for new components, providing easy access to relevant information, and use consistent naming for easy tracking.
- **Scheduled Updates:** Run the action on a cron schedule tailored to your organization's needs, ensuring regular and efficient updates.

Discover more details and a comprehensive list of `inputs` and `outputs` in the [GitHub Action repository](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-atmos-component-updater) on GitHub. 

## Usage Examples

### Workflow example

```yaml

  workflow_dispatch: {}

  schedule:
    - cron:  '0 8 * * *'  # Every day at 8am UTC

      # Install the Atmos Component Updater GitHub App:
      # https://github.com/apps/atmos-component-updater
      - name: Generate a token
        id: github-app
        uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v1
        with:

          ATMOS_CLI_CONFIG_PATH: ${{ github.workspace }}/rootfs/usr/local/etc/atmos/
        with:
          github-access-token: ${{ steps.github-app.outputs.token }}
          log-level: INFO
          vendoring-enabled: true
          max-number-of-prs: 10

      - name: Delete abandoned update branches
        uses: phpdocker-io/github-actions-delete-abandoned-branches@v2
        with:
          github_token: ${{ steps.github-app.outputs.token }}
          last_commit_age_days: 0
          allowed_prefixes: "component-update/"
          dry_run: no
```

### Requirements

This action will automatically open pull requests for updated components in your repository.
To use it, we recommend installing a GitHub App to allow GitHub Actions to create pull requests within your GitHub Organization.

- [ ] Install the Atmos Component Updater GitHub Action

1. Go to [https://github.com/apps/atmos-component-updater](https://github.com/apps/atmos-component-updater)
2. Install the Atmos Component Updater into your GitHub Organization
3. [Generate a new private key for this Github App installation](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/managing-private-keys-for-github-apps#generating-private-keys)
4. Save both the App ID and the new private key as secrets for GitHub Actions with `secrets.ATMOS_APP_ID` and `secrets.ATMOS_PRIVATE_KEY` respectively.

- [ ] Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests

1. Go to `https://github.com/organizations/YOUR_ORG/settings/actions`
2. Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

### Using a GitHub App

You may notice that we pass a generated token from a GitHub App to `github-access-token` instead of using the native `GITHUB_TOKEN`. We do this because Pull Requests will only trigger other GitHub Action Workflows if the Pull Request is created by a GitHub App or PAT. For reference, see [Triggering a workflow from a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/triggering-a-workflow#triggering-a-workflow-from-a-workflow).

To set up a GitHub App for this integration, either install the Cloud Posse managed GitHub App or create an app yourself. Install the Cloud Posse managed app from [github.com/apps/atmos-component-updater](https://github.com/apps/atmos-component-updater). If you wish to instead create the GitHub App yourself, assign only the following Repository permissions:

```diff
+ Contents: Read and write
+ Pull Requests: Read and write
+ Metadata: Read-only
```

### Using GitHub Environments

We recommend creating a new GitHub environment for Atmos (requires GitHub Enterprise). With environments, the Atmos Component Updater workflow will be required to follow any branch protection rules before running or accessing the environment's secrets. Plus, GitHub natively organizes these Deployments separately in the GitHub UI.
To configure your environment, perform the following:
1. Open "Settings" for your repository
1. Navigate to "Environments"
1. Select "New environment"
1. Name the new environment, "`atmos`"
1. In the drop-down next to "Deployment branches and tags", select "Protected branches only"
1. In "Environment secrets", create the two required secrets for App ID and App Private Key from [Using a GitHub App](#using-a-github-app)

Now the Atmos Component Updater workflow will create a new Deployment in the `atmos` environment for each workflow run, easily accessible from the GitHub UI.

### Using a Custom Atmos CLI Config Path (`atmos.yaml`)

If your [`atmos.yaml` file](https://atmos.tools/cli/configuration) is not located in the root of the infrastructure repository, you can specify the path to it using [`ATMOS_CLI_CONFIG_PATH` env variable](https://atmos.tools/cli/configuration/#environment-variables).

```yaml
  # ...
  - name: Update Atmos Components
    uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-component-updater@v1
    env:
      # Directory containing the `atmos.yaml` file
      ATMOS_CLI_CONFIG_PATH: ${{ github.workspace }}/rootfs/usr/local/etc/atmos/
    with:
      github-access-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      max-number-of-prs: 5
```

### Customize Pull Request labels, title and body

```yaml
  # ...
  - name: Update Atmos Components
    uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-component-updater@v1
    with:
      github-access-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      max-number-of-prs: 5
      pr-title: 'Update Atmos Component \`{{ component_name }}\` to {{ new_version }}'
      pr-body: |
        ## what
        Component \`{{ component_name }}\` was updated [{{ old_version }}]({{ old_version_link }}) â†’ [{{ old_version }}]({{ old_version_link }}).

        ## references
        - [{{ source_name }}]({{ source_link }})
      pr-labels: |
        component-update
        automated
        atmos
```

**IMPORTANT:** The backtick symbols must be escaped in the GitHub Action parameters. This is because GitHub evaluates whatever is in the backticks and it will render as an empty string.

#### For `title` template these placeholders are available:
- `component_name`
- `source_name`
- `old_version`
- `new_version`

#### For `body` template these placeholders are available:
- `component_name`
- `source_name`
- `source_link`
- `old_version`
- `new_version`
- `old_version_link`
- `new_version_link`
- `old_component_release_link`
- `new_component_release_link`
