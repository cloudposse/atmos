The Cloud Posse GitHub Action for "Atmos Terraform Plan" simplifies provisioning Terraform from within GitHub using workflows. Understand precisely what to expect from running a `terraform plan` from directly within the GitHub UI for any Pull Request.

Given any component and stack in an Atmos supported infrastructure environment, [`github-action-atmos-terraform-plan`](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-plan) will run `atmos terraform plan`, generate a Terraform [planfile](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/automation/automate-terraform), store this planfile in an S3 Bucket with metadata in DynamodDB, and finally format the Terraform Plan result as part of a [GitHub Workflow Job Summary](https://github.blog/2022-05-09-supercharging-github-actions-with-job-summaries/).

This action is intended to be used together with [Atmos Terraform Apply](/integrations/github-actions/atmos-terraform-apply) and [Atmos Affected Stacks](/integrations/github-actions/affected-stacks), as well as integrated into drift detection with [Atmos Terraform Detection and Remediation](/integrations/github-actions/atmos-terraform-drift-detection).

## Features

This GitHub Action incorporates superior GitOps support for Terraform by utilizing the capabilities of Atmos, enabling efficient management of large enterprise-scale environments.

* **Implements Native GitOps** with Atmos and Terraform
* **No hardcoded credentials.** Use GitHub OIDC to assume roles.
* **Compatible with GitHub Cloud & Self-hosted Runners** for maximum flexibility. 
* **Beautiful Job Summaries** don't clutter up pull requests with noisy GitHub comments
* **100% Open Source with Permissive APACHE2 License** means you have no expensive subscriptions or long-term commitments.


## Screenshots

The following screenshot showcases a successful "plan" Job Summary report. The report effectively utilizes badges to clearly indicate success or failure. Furthermore, it specifically highlights any potentially destructive operations, mitigating the risk of unintentional destructive actions. A `diff`-style format is employed to illustrate the creation, recreation, destruction, or modification of resources. Unnecessary details are neatly hidden behind a collapsible `<details/>` block, ensuring a streamlined view. Additionally, developers are provided with a direct link to access the job run, eliminating the need for manual searching to gather information about any potential issues.

By expanding the "Terraform Plan Summary" block (clicking on the `<details/>` block), the full details of the plan are visible.

Furthermore, when a resource is marked for deletion, the Plan Summary will include a warning admonition.

## Usage Example

In this example, the action is triggered when certain events occur, such as a manual workflow dispatch or the opening, synchronization, or reopening of a pull request, specifically on the main branch. It specifies specific permissions related to assuming roles in AWS. Within the "plan" job, the "component" and "stack" are hardcoded (`foobar` and `plat-ue2-sandbox`). In practice, these are usually derived from another action. 

:::tip Passing Affected Stacks

We recommend combining this action with the [`affected-stacks`](/integrations/github-actions/affected-stacks) GitHub Action inside a matrix to plan all affected stacks in parallel.

:::

```yaml title=".github/workflows/atmos-terraform-plan.yaml"
name: "atmos-terraform-plan"
on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
      - synchronize
      - reopened
    branches:
      - main
# These permissions are required for GitHub to assume roles in AWS
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read
jobs:
  plan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Plan Atmos Component
        uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-plan@v2
        with:
          component: "foobar"
          stack: "plat-ue2-sandbox"
          sha: ${{ github.sha }}
          atmos-config-path: ./rootfs/usr/local/etc/atmos/
          atmos-version: 1.63.0
```

## Requirements

This action has the requirements as [Github Actions](/integrations/github-actions/). Use the same S3 Bucket, DynamoDB table, IAM Roles and config described there.
