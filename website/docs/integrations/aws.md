Atmos currently supports one native command to make working with EKS on AWS easier. 

:::info
Just to be exceedingly clear, *nothing* about `atmos` relies on AWS; the tool is designed to be cloud agnostic.

See also:
* [`atmos aws eks update-kubeconfig`](/cli/commands/aws/eks-update-kubeconfig) which downloads the `kubeconfig` from an EKS cluster and saves it to a file.
