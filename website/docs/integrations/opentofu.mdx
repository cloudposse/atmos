Atmos natively supports [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org),
similar to the way it supports [Terraform](/integrations/terraform). It's compatible with every version of `opentofu` and designed to
work with multiple different versions of it concurrently, and can even work alongside with [HashiCorp Terraform](/integrations/terraform).

Please see the complete configuration options for [Terraform](/integrations/terraform), as they are the same for OpenTofu. We'll focus
only on what's different in this document, in order to utilize OpenTofu. Keep in mind that Atmos does not handle the downloading or installation
of OpenTofu; it assumes that any required binaries for the commands are already installed on your system.

Additionally, if using Spacelift together with Atmos, make sure you review the [Spacelift Integration](/integrations/spacelift) to make any necessary changes.

## CLI Configuration

All the default configuration settings to support OpenTofu are defined in the [Atmos CLI Configuration](/cli/configuration),
but can also be overridden at any level of the [Stack](/core-concepts/stacks/#schema) configuration.

To make OpenTofu the default command when running "terraform", modify [`atmos.yaml`](/cli/configuration) to configure the following global settings:

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    # Use the `tofu` command when calling "terraform" in Atmos.
    command: "/usr/bin/tofu"  # or just `tofu`

    # Optionally, specify a different path for OpenTofu components
    base_path: "components/tofu"
```

:::important
Atmos consistently utilizes the `terraform` keyword across all configurations, rather than `tofu` or `opentofu`.
:::

Additionally, if you prefer to run `atmos tofu` instead of `atmos terraform`, you can configure an alias.
Just add the following configuration somewhere in the `atmos.yaml` CLI config file:

```yaml
aliases:
  tofu: terraform
```

:::important
Creating aliases for `tofu` only changes the CLI invocation of `atmos terraform` and does not directly
influence the actual command that atmos executes when running Terraform. Atmos strictly adheres to the
specific `command` set in the Stack configurations.
:::

## Stack Configuration for Components

Settings for Terraform or OpenTofu can also be specified in stack configurations, where they are compatible with inheritance.
This feature allows projects to tailor behavior according to individual component needs.

While defaults for everything are defined in the `atmos.yaml`, the same settings, can be overridden by Stack configurations at any level:

- `terraform`
- `components.terraform`
- `components.terraform._component_`

For instance, you can modify the command executed for a specific component by overriding the `command` parameter.
This flexibility is particularly valuable for gradually transitioning to OpenTofu or managing components that are
compatible only with HashiCorp Terraform.

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    vpc:
      command: "/usr/local/bin/tofu-1.7"
```

## Example: Provision a Terraform Component with OpenTofu

:::note
In the following examples, we'll assume that `tofu` is an Atmos alias for the `terraform` command.

```yaml
aliases:
  tofu: terraform
```

:::

Once you've configured Atmos to utilize `tofu` — either by adjusting the default `terraform.command` in the `atmos.yaml`
or by specifying the `command` for an individual component — provisioning any component follows the same procedure as
you would typically use for Terraform.

For example, to provision a Terraform component using OpenTofu, run the following commands:

```console
atmos tofu plan eks --stack=ue2-dev
atmos tofu apply eks --stack=ue2-dev
```

where:

- `eks` is the Terraform component to provision (from the `components/terraform` folder)
- `--stack=ue2-dev` is the stack to provision the component into

Short versions of all command-line arguments can be used:

```console
atmos tofu plan eks -s ue2-dev
atmos tofu apply eks -s ue2-dev
```
