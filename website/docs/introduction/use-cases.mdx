<Intro>
Atmos has proven time and again that it works great for these key use cases. Itâ€™s versatile like a Swiss Army knife and reliable like a well-oiled machine, making it a solid choice for cloud infrastructure and DevOps.
</Intro>

- **Managing Large Multi-Account Cloud Environments.** <br/> Suitable for organizations using multiple cloud accounts to separate different projects or stages of development.
- **Cross-Platform Cloud Architectures.** <br/> Ideal for businesses that need to manage the configuration of services across AWS, GCP, Azure, etc., to build a cohesive system.
- **Multi-Tenant Systems for SaaS.** <br/> Perfect for SaaS companies looking to host multiple customers within a unified infrastructure. Simply define a baseline tenant configuration once, and then seamlessly onboard new tenants by reusing this baseline through pure configuration, bypassing the need for further code development.
- **Efficient Multi-Region Deployments.** <br/> Atmos facilitates streamlined multi-region deployments by enabling businesses to define baseline configurations with [stacks](/core-concepts/stacks/) and extend them across regions with DRY principles through [imports](/core-concepts/stacks/imports) and [inheritance](/core-concepts/stacks/inheritance).
- **Compliant Infrastructure for Regulated Industries.** <br/> Atmos empowers DevOps and SecOps teams to create vetted configurations that comply with SOC2, HIPAA, HITRUST, PCI, and other regulatory standards. These configurations can then be efficiently shared and reused across the organization via [service catalogs](/core-concepts/stacks/catalogs), [component libraries](/core-concepts/components/library), [vendoring](/core-concepts/vendor), and [OPA policies](/core-concepts/validate/opa), simplifying the process of achieving and maintaining rigorous compliance.
- **Empowering Teams with Self-Service Infrastructure.** <br/> Allows teams to manage their infrastructure needs independently, using 
  predefined templates and policies.
- **Streamlining Deployment with Service Catalogs, Landing Zones, and Blueprints:** Provides businesses the ability to craft their own ready-to-use templates and guidelines for setting up cloud environments quickly and consistently, tailored to the unique needs of the organization.
