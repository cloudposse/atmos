Use Atmos to easily compose complex architectures based on Terraform with very [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) configuration. 
Concepts like [Stacks](/core-concepts/stacks) and [Components](/core-concepts/components)
help you overcome most of [Terraform's limitations](/reference/terraform-limitations/)
by using [established conventions](/core-concepts) and proven [design patterns](/design-patterns/).

## Introduction

With Atmos, you gain simplified control over your cloud resources, enabling you to manage unlimited environments, services, 
and configurations using simple, clear YAML configuration files. Best of all, it works without writing a single line of HCL or code generation. 
This approach not only ensures that your infrastructure's deployment and scaling are as straightforward as executing a single command,
 but also cleanly separates your configuration from your Terraform code keeping it portable, thereby streamlining the entire process.

Designed to operate seamlessly across diverse environments—be it production, staging, development, or testing — Atmos integrates 
perfectly into continuous integration (CI/CD) workflows with its [GitHub Actions](/integrations/github-actions/) or support for other [TACOS](/integrations/).
It offers a comprehensive set of commands for managing the lifecycle of your cloud infrastructure, from creation to maintenance and beyond.

## How does Atmos work?

At a high-level, Atmos is responsible for managing the configuration that gets passed to Components when they are instantiated.

To make this less abstract, we're going to focus on Terraform and how configuration gets passed to it.
The secret to scaling architectures with Terraform, is to decompose it into smaller root modules. We want to keep these root modules 
as generic and reusable as possible by parameterizing them. In doing so, we shift the complexity from the HCL code, to managing
the configuration itself. In terraform, there is the concept of variable files (aka "var files"), 
which are JSON-esque configuration files and how external configuration is passed to `terraform plan` using 
the [`-var-file` argument](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables#variable-definitions-tfvars-files). 
All we need to do is tap into this power, and pass our own configuration that comes from Atmos.

With Atmos, we organize our configuration into [Stacks](/core-concepts/stacks). Stacks are YAML manifests that compose all the 
[Components](/core-concepts/components) (e.g. Terraform root modules) we need to bring up our environment. For example, in its
simplest form, we may have `production`, `dev`, and `staging` stacks.  We can then deploy any of these stacks to provision 
everything using Terraform. All that Atmos does, is deep-merge the variables from the stack configurations and produce a single "var file" 
that we pass to the `terraform plan`. There's very little magic, which is how to ensure future compatibility with Terraform and 
interoperability with the entire Terraform ecosystem.

:::info Summary
- Terraform configuration is difficult to manage at scale without tooling
- Terraform by itself is not enough to be successful
- Atmos makes managing those configurations easier

* **Terminal UI** Atmos ships with a polished terminal UI making it easy for beginners (and power users) to interact with Terraform,
  workflows and other commands.
* **Components** A generic abstraction for anything that gets deployed (e.g. a Terraform "root" module)
* **Stacks** Atmos stacks serve as a powerful abstraction layer, defined in YAML, that are used to automate the orchestration,
  deployment, and lifecycles of loosely coupled components (e.g. Terraform "root" modules). They facilitate scalable infrastructure
  as code configurations by allowing environments to inherit from one or more common base configurations and import settings, reducing manual configuration efforts and duplication. Stacks enhance productivity by enabling developers to rapidly create, duplicate, or update infrastructure configurations in a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) manner, leveraging vanilla Terraform root modules, just in a more efficient and consistent way.
* **Deep-merged Imports & Inheritance** easily re-use configuration with [imports](/core-concepts/stacks/imports) that gets deep-merged, or [inherit from multiple other settings](/core-concepts/components/inheritance).
* **Vendoring** can [pull down any dependencies](/core-concepts/vendoring/) from remote sources like Git, OCI, HTTP, etc.
* **Schema Validation** Atmos can validate your configuration against a JSON schema to ensure it's correct.
* **OPA Policy Controls** Integrates Open Policy Agent for high-level policy enforcement at the configuration level.
  Different stacks can use different policies making it a powerful control for enterprise environments.
* **Native Terraform Support** including backend generation (leveraging inheritance), and varfile generation (ensuring atmos works with vanilla terraform!)
* **Mixins** are reusable pieces of configuration snippets that can be included in multiple stack configurations to avoid repetition.
  They allow for defining common settings, variables, or configurations once and applying them across various environments efficiently.
* **Custom Commands** ensure that atmos is fully extensible and can wrap literally any command you configure, with full access to the stack configuration.
* **Terraform Provider** Atmos has a Terraform provider that can be used to manage Atmos configurations and stacks.
* **Service Catalogs** are a collection of reusable components (e.g. Terraform root modules) that can be shared across stacks,
  enabling teams to build and maintain a library of reusable components for consistent and efficient infrastructure management.
* **Component Libraries** are a collection of reusable components (e.g. Terraform root modules) that can be shared across stacks,
  enabling teams to build and maintain a library of reusable components for consistent and efficient infrastructure management.
* **Automatic Component Updates** Using the [Atmos Component Updater GitHub Action](/integrations/github-actions/component-updater), Pull Requests are automatically generated to update components
  to their latest versions, ensuring the infrastructure remains continually up-to-date.
* **Cloud-agonostic** Nothiping in Atmos is tied to a specific cloud provider. It's designed to work across various cloud platforms
  (e.g. AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.), enhancing interoperability rather than tying users to a single cloud environment.
* **Terraform Support** Atmos is designed to work with Terraform, and can be used to manage Terraform configurations and deployments.
* **Helmfile Support** Atmos natively supports opinionated workflows for [Helmfile](/integrations/helmfile), a declarative specification
  for deploying helm charts.
* **GitHub Actions Support** Implement GitOps workflows for Terraform [Plan](/integrations/github-actions/atmos-terraform-plan),
  [Apply](/integrations/github-actions/atmos-terraform-plan) and [Drift Detection](/integrations/github-actions/atmos-terraform-drift-detection)
  with GitHub Actions
* **Works with Atlantis, and Spacelift out-of-the-box:** Atmos can be used to manage the configuration of these popular
  Terraform Automation & Collaboration Software (**TACOS**).
* **Workflow Orchestration:** Atmos provides a comprehensive support for [workflows to run commands](/core-concepts/workflows) for managing the
  lifecycle of your cloud infrastructure, from bootstrapping to maintenance and beyond.

## What Atmos is Not...

It might help to also understand what Atmos is not attempting to replace:

- **Atmos is not an alternative for certain tools.** Under the hood, it still executes `terraform`, `kubectl`, `docker`, `helm`, etc.
  Atmos composes tools together via [Stack](/core-concepts/stacks/) configurations and orchestrates their execution via [workflows](/core-concepts/workflows/), [custom commands](/core-concepts/custom-commands/), or [other integrations](/integrations/).
- **Atmos is not an alternative to CI/CD systems.**  It complements these systems by being an operational tool that can be invoked
  from within CI/CD pipelines, as detailed in our [integrations](/integrations/).
- **Atmos is not a competitor to Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise.** It’s a command-line tool that makes working with other
  CLI’s like `terraform`, `helm` and other infrastructure management tools better. It streamlines infrastructure configuration management
  and integrates nicely with existing CI/CD pipelines. Atmos is not a commercial product and has no proprietary lock-ins.
- **Atmos is not tied to any specific cloud provider.** It is cloud-agnostic, and designed to work across various cloud platforms
  (e.g. AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.), enhancing interoperability rather than tying users to a single cloud environment.
- **Atmos is not a configuration management database ([CMDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_management_database)).** Although it can manage and deploy the desired state of configurations,
  it doesn't serve as a repository for tracking the actual state of IT assets and configurations in the _traditional_ sense of a CMDB.
- **Atmos is not a replacement for development environments or IDEs.** It focuses on the orchestration and deployment aspects of infrastructure, without aiming to replace the tools developers use to write and test code.
