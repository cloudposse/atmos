As developers grow more comfortable with Terraform, they often transition to a more ambitious approach of automating everything.

This results in creating a monolithic "root module", also known as a Terralith. This stage is characterized by an expansive,
all-encompassing Terraform configuration that attempts to manage every aspect of the infrastructure within a single module.

1. Developers begin by composing a single root module that continuously expands.
2. Define all environments as code (dev, staging, production) within the single Terraform root module.
3. Extensive use of feature flags for everything (e.g. `prod_cluster_size`, `staging_cluster_size`, etc.)

:::warning New Problems
1. Massive blast radius for every change. It's literally scary to apply the changes, because anything can go wrong.
2. Brittle and prolonged plan/apply cycles, often disrupted by transient errors, expiring credentials and API rate limits, require frequent, manual retries.
3. Large root modules become more complicated, often necessitating the use of targeted applies (e.g. `terraform apply -target`) as a workaround for cycles.
4. Far from DRY. Significant code duplication. Tons parameters are used for toggling settings for each environment within the same root module.
5. No practical way to separate responsibilities by team within the root module.
6. Testing every parameter combination is impossible.
