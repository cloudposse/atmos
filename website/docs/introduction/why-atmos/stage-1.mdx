<Intro>
At this initial stage, developers begin their Terraform journey with the basics, focusing on getting a grasp of Terraform's
core concepts with a straightforward and simple implementation.
</Intro>

1. Developers roll up their sleeves to get a simple terraform example up and running. They create resources directly in the
   configuration without the use of modules. This phase is characterized by hard-coded settings and a hands-on approach to learning
   Terraform's syntax and capabilities.
2. Local state files are used since this is just an exploration. This approach simplifies the learning process by avoiding the complexities of remote state management.
3. Version control systems are not yet in use. Developers store their Terraform configurations directly on their local workstations
   allowing them to focus on learning Terraform's mechanics without the added complexity of collaboration tools or best practices.

:::warning New Problems
1. How do we handle secrets?
2. Where do we store the state file?
3. How do we maintain something with so many hardcoded settings?
:::

## Realization

With this quick win, developers realize Terraform's power, so they are eager to [Terraform everything in sight](/introduction/why-atmos/stage-2).
