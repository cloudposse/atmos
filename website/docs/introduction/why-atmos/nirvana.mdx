## The Atmos Difference

Atmos lets you model the configuration of your cloud architecture in a way that makes logical sense.
You can then develop components using any toolchain you want, including Terraform, to implement
the components of your infrastructure.
</Intro>

Most teams donâ€™t have a Terraform problem; they struggle with modeling their architecture in a reusable manner. Terraform provides everything needed to provision infrastructure, but an effective strategy to model cloud architecture is missing. Atmos fills this gap with a robust framework, offering design patterns, best practices, and advanced tooling to optimize your cloud architecture.

**A well-designed framework does not limit you; it enables you. It doesnâ€™t hold you back; it empowers you.**

## The Benefits of Using Atmos

Atmos provides a lightweight framework around Terraform, making it easier to manage and deploy your infrastructure
across cloud platforms. It leverages vanilla Terraform for all its strengths, ensuring you can harness the full power
of Terraform. Additionally, with Atmos, you no longer need to rely on code generation or templating HCL.

You'll have a clear separation of concerns, consistent conventions, and organized project structures.

Configuration is organized into stacks defined by YAML and separate from components (terraform root modules).
This ensures root modules remain highly reusable across teams and promotes testing.

It was designed to be used with CI/CD, so you can integrate with [GitHub Actions](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions), [Spacelift](https://atmos.tools/integrations/spacelift), or even [Atlantis](https://atmos.tools/integrations/atlantis).

And it was [inspired by giants](/reference/alternatives). We took the best of what we learned from all these other tools stuck into Atmos. So if you like the concepts of imports, inheritance, layering, and composition, you'll love Atmos.

Oh yes, and it's entirely free and truly Open Source (licensed APACHE2) like [everything else Cloud Posse builds](https://github.com/cloudposse)! ðŸ”¥
