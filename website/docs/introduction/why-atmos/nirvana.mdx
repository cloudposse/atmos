## The Atmos Difference

Atmos lets you model the configuration of your cloud architecture in a way that makes logical sense. 
You can then develop components using any toolchain you want, including Terraform, to implement
the components of your infrastructure. This is why itâ€™s not a Terraform problem but a data modeling and
configuration modeling problem. For some reason, the same rigor that has been applied to software engineering
for decades is not being applied to DevOps tooling. Thatâ€™s what Atmos brings to the table with our framework, 
design patterns, best practices, and tooling.

What you really need is a strategy for approaching cloud architecture that translates to how you manage your configuration
and design all the components it comprises. 

**A well-designed framework does not limit you; it enables you. It doesnâ€™t hold you back; it empowers you.**

## The Benefits of Using Atmos

Atmos provides a lightweight framework around Terraform, making it easier to manage and deploy your infrastructure
across cloud platforms. It leverages vanilla Terraform for all its strengths, ensuring you can harness the full power
of Terraform. Additionally, with Atmos, you no longer need to rely on code generation or templating HCL.

You'll have a clear separation of concerns, consistent conventions, and organized project structures.

Configuration is organized into Stacks defined by YAML, separate from Components (terraform root modules).
This ensures root modules remain highly reusable across teams and promotes testing.  

It was designed to be a turnkey solution for CI/CD, so you can integrate with
[GitHub Actions](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions), [Spacelift](https://atmos.tools/integrations/spacelift),
or even [Atlantis](https://atmos.tools/integrations/atlantis).

And it was [inspired by giants](/reference/alternatives). We took the best of what we learned from all these other tools stuck into Atmos.
So if you like the concepts of imports, inheritance, layering, and composition, you'll love Atmos.

Oh yes, and it's entirely free and truly Open Source (licensed APACHE2) like [everything else Cloud Posse builds](https://github.com/cloudposse)! ðŸ”¥
