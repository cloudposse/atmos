At this point, you might be ready to thow in the towel on Terraform. You start looking for alternatives like [CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/),
[CDK TF](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cdktf), [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/), 
or even maybe [Crossplane](https://www.crossplane.io/).

As the complexity and scale of Terraform projects reach a tipping point, developers face a stark realization.
Questions arise about the inherent difficulties of managing sprawling infrastructure code bases using Terraform,
leading to a moment of reckoning. Some might question if Terraform is even the right tool.

:::danger

- Scripts all over the place that call terraform
- Inconsistent conventions on what is a module, root module and when to combine them
- Root modules that need to be provisioned in a specific order to bring them up and down, often necessitating the use of `-target`
- No way to define dependencies between root modules
- Passing state between root modules is inconsistent
- Automating the terraform in CI/CD is oversimplified, lacking project-level locks and `planfile` retrieval
- Inconsistent conventions or a total lack of conventions
- Incomplete or out-of-date documentation
- **No one understands how it all works anymore ‚ö†Ô∏è**

:::

**But the problem isn't Terraform. The problem is how you are using Terraform.**

Changing the tool, will not change the outcome. Even if you decide to switch to a different tool, you will face the same challenges, 
just with a different set of limitations.

What you really need is a strategy for approaching cloud architecture that translates to how you manage the Configuration
 and design all the components it comprises.

Most developers never write their own framework; they use one that‚Äôs been established and proven by countless enterprises and
supported by a community. Why should we expect DevOps teams to be equipped and prepared to design an extensible framework when
they‚Äôve never done it before? 

A well-designed framework does not limit you; it enables you. It doesn‚Äôt hold you back; it empowers you.
