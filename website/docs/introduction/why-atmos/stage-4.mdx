Developers begin their Terraform journey often by crafting their own modules, initially overlooking the extensive ecosystem of pre-existing 
modules, such [Cloud Posse's terraform modules](https://github.com/cloudposse) ecosystem.

1. Developers, initially crafting bespoke modules, discover hundreds of freely available open-source Terraform modules.
2. With the recognition of high-quality, well-maintained open-source modules, developers start to replace their custom solutions (like VPCs and clusters) with those from the community, streamlining their infrastructure code.
3. The switch to open-source modules often leads to pull requests that dramatically reduce the complexity and lines of code,
   sometimes cutting out hundreds or even thousands of lines, to the team's astonishment and delight.

:::warning New Problems
1. How will they keep their modules current and ensure they meet certain policies for the organization?
2. Which of the XYZ modules should they pick? For example, there are dozens of VPC modules. What if 2 different teams pick different ones?
3. The quality of open-source modules varies drastically. 
   - What if the modules are abandoned? 
   - What if they aren't updated to support the latest versions? 
   - What if they don't accept pull requests?
   - What if two modules conflict with each other?
