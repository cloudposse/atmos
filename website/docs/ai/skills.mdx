# AI Skills

<Experimental />

Atmos AI includes a powerful skill system that provides specialized AI assistants for different infrastructure tasks. Each skill has a customized system prompt and tool access tailored to its specific domain. Skills follow the [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io) governed by the Linux Foundation's Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF).

## Overview

Skills are specialized AI assistants that focus on specific aspects of infrastructure management. Instead of having one general-purpose AI, you can switch between skills optimized for:

- **Stack Analysis** - Understanding configurations and dependencies
- **Component Refactoring** - Improving Terraform/Helmfile code

## Skill Prompt System

Atmos AI uses a **SKILL.md format** that follows the [Agent Skills open standard](https://agentskills.io) governed by the Linux Foundation's Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF). Each built-in skill has a dedicated SKILL.md file containing YAML frontmatter metadata and Markdown system prompt.

### Architecture

**Separation of Concerns:**
- **Go code** (`pkg/ai/skills/`) - Skill infrastructure, tool execution, registry, session management
- **SKILL.md files** (`pkg/ai/skills/builtin/`) - Skill metadata and instructions

This design provides several key benefits:

**For Development:**
- 🔧 Update skill behavior without recompiling Atmos
- 📝 Easy to maintain and version control prompt changes
- 🤝 Community can contribute skill improvements via pull requests
- 📊 Track prompt evolution in Git history
- 🧪 Test different prompt strategies easily

**For Users:**
- 🎯 Richer, more specialized skill responses
- 🔄 Consistent skill behavior across sessions
- 📚 Skills stay up-to-date with latest Atmos patterns
- ⚡ Token-efficient progressive disclosure (prompts load only when skill is activated)

### How It Works

#### 1. Embedded Filesystem

All skill SKILL.md files are embedded into the Atmos binary using Go's `//go:embed` directive:

```
pkg/ai/skills/builtin/
├── general/
│   └── SKILL.md                  # 🤖 General skill (~6KB)
├── stack-analyzer/
│   └── SKILL.md                  # 📊 Stack analysis (~6KB)
├── component-refactor/
│   └── SKILL.md                  # 🔧 Component refactoring (~6KB)
├── security-auditor/
│   └── SKILL.md                  # 🔒 Security auditing (~6KB)
└── config-validator/
    └── SKILL.md                  # ✅ Config validation (~6KB)
```

**Key characteristics:**
- Skills are **compiled into the binary** (no external files needed at runtime)
- Source files remain **editable** in the repository
- Changes require **rebuilding Atmos** to take effect
- Total size: ~30KB for all 5 skills

#### 2. Dynamic Loading

Prompts are loaded dynamically when you interact with skills:

```
Skill Initialization (startup)
  → LoadSystemPrompt("general/SKILL.md")
  → Skill has full instructions

Skill Switching (Ctrl+A)
  → User selects "Stack Analyzer"
  → LoadSystemPrompt("stack-analyzer/SKILL.md")
  → Skill now has specialized stack analysis knowledge

Session Restore
  → Load saved session
  → LoadSystemPrompt("{saved-skill}/SKILL.md")
  → Continue with same skill from last session
```

This **progressive disclosure** approach minimizes token usage - each skill's instructions are only loaded when that skill is active.

#### 3. SKILL.md File Structure

Each skill follows the SKILL.md format with YAML frontmatter and Markdown body:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
display_name: "Skill Display Name"
description: Brief description of the skill
version: 1.0.0
category: general|analysis|refactor|security|validation|optimization
icon: 🤖

Each skill's prompt extracts relevant sections from these sources. For example:

- **Stack Analyzer** gets: Stack concepts, import patterns, `describe` commands
- **Component Refactor** gets: Component design best practices, Terraform patterns
- **Security Auditor** gets: Security checklist, IAM policies, encryption patterns
- **Config Validator** gets: YAML syntax, schema validation, error messages

### Contributing to Skill Prompts

Want to improve a skill? Here's how:

#### View Current Prompts

Skill prompts are in the Atmos repository:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos.git
cd atmos

# View skill prompts
ls -la pkg/ai/skills/builtin/
cat pkg/ai/skills/builtin/general/SKILL.md
```

#### Modify a Prompt

1. **Edit the SKILL.md file:**
   ```bash
   # Make your improvements
   vim pkg/ai/skills/builtin/stack-analyzer/SKILL.md
   ```

2. **Test locally:**
   ```bash
   # Rebuild Atmos with your changes

- ❌ Add instructions unrelated to the skill's domain
- ❌ Remove important safety considerations
- ❌ Break the SKILL.md structure

**Example of a good improvement:**

```diff
# In security-auditor/SKILL.md

## Instructions

+### Check for Unused Security Groups
+
+When auditing network security:
+1. List all security groups in the stack
+2. Check for groups with no attached resources
+3. Flag unused groups as cost/security risk
+4. Recommend cleanup workflow
+
 ### Issue 1: Overly Permissive IAM
 ...
```

### Setting Default Skill

Configure the default skill in `atmos.yaml`:

<File title="atmos.yaml">
```yaml
settings:
  ai:
    default_provider: anthropic
    default_skill: stack-analyzer  # Start with stack analyzer

    providers:
      anthropic:
        model: claude-sonnet-4-5
```
</File>

Now `atmos ai chat` will start with the Stack Analyzer skill by default.

## Custom Skills

Create your own specialized skills by adding them to `atmos.yaml`:

### Example: Cost Optimization Skill

<File title="atmos.yaml">
```yaml
settings:
  ai:
    skills:
      cost-optimizer:
        display_name: "Cost Optimizer"
        description: "Analyzes infrastructure for cost savings opportunities"
        category: "analysis"

        system_prompt: |
          You are a cost optimization expert for Atmos infrastructure.

          FOCUS AREAS:
          - Identify overprovisioned resources
          - Suggest rightsizing opportunities
          - Find unused or idle resources
          - Recommend reserved instances
          - Analyze data transfer costs

          ANALYSIS APPROACH:
          1. Examine component configurations
          2. Identify cost optimization opportunities
          3. Estimate potential savings
          4. Prioritize recommendations by impact
          5. Provide specific implementation steps

          Always use tools to gather data before making recommendations.

        allowed_tools:
          - atmos_describe_component
          - atmos_describe_stacks
          - atmos_list_stacks
          - read_stack_file

```

**Restricted Tools** (require confirmation):
```yaml
allowed_tools:
  - read_file
  - edit_file
restricted_tools:
  - edit_file  # User must confirm before skill can edit files
```

**Read-Only Skill**:
```yaml
allowed_tools:
  - atmos_describe_component
  - atmos_list_stacks
  - read_file
  - search_files
# No write/execute tools = read-only
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Use the Right Skill for the Task

Don't use the general skill for everything:

❌ **Wrong**:
```bash
atmos ai chat
You: "Audit my infrastructure for security issues"
# General skill lacks security expertise
```

✅ **Right**:
```bash
atmos ai chat
# Press Ctrl+A, select "Security Auditor"
You: "Audit my infrastructure for security issues"
# Security Auditor provides comprehensive security analysis
```

### 2. Switch Skills as Your Work Progresses

Different phases need different skills:

```bash
# Phase 1: Understanding (Stack Analyzer)
Ctrl+A → Stack Analyzer
"Explain the prod-use1-eks configuration"

# Phase 2: Improvement (Component Refactor)
Ctrl+A → Component Refactor
"Refactor the EKS component to use module v5"

# Phase 3: Validation (Config Validator)
Ctrl+A → Config Validator
"Validate all my changes"

# Phase 4: Security Review (Security Auditor)
Ctrl+A → Security Auditor
"Check for any security issues introduced"
```

### 3. Create Domain-Specific Skills

For specialized workflows, create custom skills:

**Multi-Region Deployment Skill**:
```yaml
skills:
  multi-region:
    display_name: "Multi-Region Deployer"
    description: "Handles multi-region deployment workflows"
    system_prompt: |
      You specialize in multi-region deployments.

      ALWAYS consider:
      - Regional resource naming
      - Cross-region dependencies
      - Data replication
      - Failover configurations

      When deploying to multiple regions, ensure consistency.
```

**Migration Skill**:
```yaml
skills:
  migrator:
    display_name: "Infrastructure Migrator"
    description: "Migrates infrastructure between accounts/regions"
    system_prompt: |
      You specialize in infrastructure migrations.

      MIGRATION CHECKLIST:
      - Verify state file location
      - Check cross-account permissions
      - Plan for DNS cutover
      - Test rollback procedures

      Always provide step-by-step migration plans.
```

### 4. Restrict Dangerous Operations

For sensitive environments, restrict write access:

```yaml
skills:
  prod-analyzer:
    display_name: "Production Analyzer"
    description: "Read-only analysis of production infrastructure"
    allowed_tools:
      # Only read operations
      - atmos_describe_component
      - atmos_describe_stacks
      - atmos_list_stacks
      - read_file
      - read_stack_file
      - search_files
      # No edit_file, write_file, or execute_bash
```

### 5. Document Custom Skill Purpose

Add clear descriptions so team members know when to use each skill:

```yaml
skills:
  disaster-recovery:
    display_name: "Disaster Recovery Planner"
    description: "Creates and reviews DR plans for infrastructure. Use for: backup configs, failover testing, RTO/RPO analysis."
    # Clear description tells users exactly when to use this skill
```

## Performance Tips

### Skill Selection for Optimal Results

Choosing the right skill significantly impacts response quality and speed. Here's when to use each built-in skill:

#### 🤖 General Skill
**Best for:**
- Initial exploration and discovery
- Questions that span multiple domains
- When you're unsure which specialized skill to use
- Quick one-off queries

**Performance characteristics:**
- ✅ Most flexible - can handle any task
- ✅ No tool restrictions - fastest for multi-step workflows
- ⚠️ Less specialized - may provide generic answers for domain-specific questions

**Example use cases:**
```bash
# Good for general skill
"What is Atmos?"
"List all available stacks and their components"
"Help me debug this error: [error message]"
```

---

#### 📊 Stack Analyzer Skill
**Best for:**
- Understanding stack configurations and relationships
- Analyzing component dependencies
- Architecture reviews
- Configuration impact analysis

**Performance characteristics:**
- ✅ Highly specialized - produces detailed architectural insights
- ✅ Read-only - safe for production analysis
- ✅ Optimized prompts - better at finding configuration patterns
- ⚠️ Limited to analysis tools - can't make changes

**Example use cases:**
```bash
# Good for stack analyzer
"Analyze dependencies between all prod stacks"
"Show me the inheritance chain for vpc component"
"What stacks will be affected if I change the base mixin?"
"Compare staging and prod configurations"
```

---

#### 🔧 Component Refactor Skill
**Best for:**
- Improving Terraform/Helmfile code quality
- Modernizing infrastructure code
- Applying best practices
- Refactoring for consistency

**Performance characteristics:**
- ✅ Code-focused - understands infrastructure-as-code patterns
- ✅ Write access - can make improvements directly
- ✅ Incremental changes - makes one improvement at a time with explanations
- ⚠️ Requires confirmation - each change needs approval (by design)

**Example use cases:**
```bash
# Good for component refactor
"Refactor the VPC component to use Terraform 1.5 syntax"
"Update all components to use consistent variable naming"
"Improve the RDS module with better defaults"
"Modernize the EKS configuration"
```

---

#### 🔒 Security Auditor Skill
**Best for:**
- Security reviews and audits
- Compliance checking
- Finding vulnerabilities
- IAM policy analysis

**Performance characteristics:**
- ✅ Security-focused - trained to spot vulnerabilities
- ✅ Systematic approach - checks multiple security dimensions
- ✅ Severity classification - prioritizes critical issues
- ⚠️ Read-only - identifies but doesn't fix issues

**Example use cases:**
```bash
# Good for security auditor
"Audit VPC security groups for overly permissive rules"
"Check all IAM policies for wildcards"
"Find unencrypted resources across all stacks"
"Identify publicly accessible resources"
```

---

#### ✅ Config Validator Skill
**Best for:**
- YAML syntax validation
- Schema compliance checking
- Finding configuration errors
- Pre-deployment validation

**Performance characteristics:**
- ✅ Validation-focused - catches config errors quickly
- ✅ Schema-aware - understands Atmos configuration structure
- ✅ Line-specific errors - provides exact file locations
- ⚠️ Limited scope - only validates, doesn't analyze content

**Example use cases:**
```bash
# Good for config validator
"Validate all stack configurations"
"Check for YAML syntax errors in prod stacks"
"Verify all required fields are present"
"Find circular import dependencies"
```

---

### Custom vs Built-in Skills: Performance Implications

#### Built-in Skills (Recommended)

**Advantages:**
- ✅ **Pre-optimized** - System prompts are carefully tuned for Atmos workflows
- ✅ **Consistent behavior** - Same experience across all Atmos installations
- ✅ **Maintained** - Updated with Atmos releases for improved performance
- ✅ **Well-tested** - Validated against common infrastructure patterns
- ✅ **Lower latency** - No configuration parsing overhead

**When to use:**
- You're performing standard infrastructure operations
- You want proven, reliable results
- Your team needs consistent AI behavior
- You're new to Atmos AI skills

#### Custom Skills

**Advantages:**
- ✅ **Domain-specific** - Tailored to your organization's needs
- ✅ **Workflow-optimized** - Built for your specific processes
- ✅ **Team knowledge** - Can encode institutional knowledge
- ✅ **Compliance-focused** - Can enforce company policies

**Considerations:**
- ⚠️ **Prompt engineering required** - Needs careful crafting for good results
- ⚠️ **Testing needed** - Must validate behavior across scenarios
- ⚠️ **Maintenance overhead** - Requires updates as workflows change
- ⚠️ **Inconsistent results** - Poorly-written prompts reduce quality

**When to create custom skills:**
```yaml
# Good reasons for custom skills
1. Specialized workflows
   Example: Multi-cloud deployment skill that understands your AWS+Azure patterns

2. Company-specific policies
   Example: Compliance skill that enforces internal naming conventions

3. Domain expertise
   Example: Cost optimization skill tuned for your infrastructure patterns

4. Team workflows
   Example: Migration skill with your specific migration checklist
```

**When to stick with built-in:**
```yaml
# Better served by built-in skills
❌ "I want a VPC analysis skill"
   → Use Stack Analyzer - already optimized for this

❌ "I need a security checker"
   → Use Security Auditor - comprehensive coverage built-in

❌ "I want to validate configs"
   → Use Config Validator - knows Atmos schema perfectly

❌ "I need to refactor code"
   → Use Component Refactor - understands IaC best practices
```

### Performance Optimization Tips

#### 1. Start Specific, Not General

❌ **Slower**:
```bash
# Using general skill for specialized task
atmos ai chat
You: "Check my infrastructure for security issues"
# Generic analysis, may miss domain-specific vulnerabilities
```

✅ **Faster**:
```bash
# Using specialized skill
atmos ai chat
Ctrl+A → Security Auditor
You: "Check my infrastructure for security issues"
# Focused, comprehensive security analysis
```

#### 2. Use Skill Persistence

✅ **Efficient**:
```bash
# Create session with appropriate skill
atmos ai chat --session vpc-security-review
Ctrl+A → Security Auditor
# Perform reviews...

# Next time - skill automatically restored
atmos ai chat --session vpc-security-review
# ✅ Starts with Security Auditor, no need to switch
```

#### 3. Switch Skills During Workflows

✅ **Optimal workflow**:
```bash
# Analysis phase
Ctrl+A → Stack Analyzer
"Analyze prod infrastructure"

# Improvement phase
Ctrl+A → Component Refactor
"Refactor based on analysis"

# Validation phase
Ctrl+A → Config Validator
"Validate changes"

# Security review
Ctrl+A → Security Auditor
"Security audit of changes"
```

Each skill provides better results for its phase than using General skill throughout.

#### 4. Limit Custom Skill Complexity

**Simple, focused skills perform better:**

✅ **Good - Focused custom skill**:
```yaml
skills:
  cost-optimizer:
    description: "Analyzes and recommends cost optimizations"
    system_prompt: |
      You specialize in AWS cost optimization.
      Focus on: unused resources, rightsizing, reserved instances.
```

❌ **Bad - Overly complex skill**:
```yaml
skills:
  everything-skill:
    description: "Does security, cost, compliance, and refactoring"
    system_prompt: |
      You do security AND cost AND compliance AND refactoring AND...
      # Too many responsibilities = poor performance in all areas
```

#### 5. Optimize Tool Access

**Give skills only what they need:**

✅ **Efficient - Minimal tool set**:
```yaml
skills:
  cost-analyzer:
    allowed_tools:
      - atmos_describe_component
      - atmos_list_stacks
      - read_file
    # Fast - AI only sees relevant tools
```

❌ **Slower - Unnecessary tools**:
```yaml
skills:
  cost-analyzer:
    allowed_tools: []  # All tools exposed
    # Slower - AI must evaluate all tools, even irrelevant ones
```

### Measuring Skill Performance

You can compare skill effectiveness:

**Response Quality:**
```bash
# Same question, different skills
# General skill
atmos ai chat
"Analyze VPC security"
→ Generic security check

# Security Auditor skill
Ctrl+A → Security Auditor
"Analyze VPC security"
→ Comprehensive security audit with:
  - Specific vulnerability identification
  - Severity classification
  - Remediation steps
  - Compliance implications
```

**Speed (fewer tool calls = faster):**
```bash
# Specialized skills make better tool choices
Security Auditor: 3-4 focused tool calls
General Skill: 5-7 exploratory tool calls
```

**Accuracy (domain expertise matters):**
```bash
# Security Auditor finds issues General skill misses:
- Subtle IAM policy problems
- Network security misconfigurations
- Encryption gaps
- Compliance violations
```

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Available

**Check configuration**:

<Terminal title="terminal">
```bash
atmos describe config | grep -A 20 "ai:"
```
</Terminal>

Ensure your custom skill is properly defined in `atmos.yaml`.

### Skill Not Using Specialized Prompt

**Verify skill is active**:

When you switch skills, you should see:
```
System: Switched to skill: Stack Analyzer (Analyze stack configurations and dependencies)
```

If you don't see this message, the skill switch didn't work. Press Ctrl+A again and ensure you press Enter on the desired skill.

### Custom Skill Tools Not Working

**Check tool names**:

Tool names must match exactly:
- ✅ `atmos_describe_component`
- ❌ `describe_component` (missing prefix)
- ❌ `atmos-describe-component` (wrong separator)

**Verify tool exists**:

<Terminal title="terminal">
```bash
# In chat, ask:
"What tools do you have access to?"

# Skill will list available tools
```
</Terminal>

### Restricted Tools Not Asking for Confirmation

This is expected behavior in the current implementation. The `restricted_tools` field is defined in the schema but confirmation prompts will be added in a future release. For now, use `allowed_tools` to completely block access to dangerous operations.
