# AI Sessions

Atmos AI supports persistent conversation sessions that maintain message history across CLI invocations. Sessions allow you to have long-running conversations with the AI assistant, picking up exactly where you left off.

## Overview

Sessions provide:
- **Persistent History**: Complete conversation history saved locally
- **Named Sessions**: Organize conversations by topic or project
- **Context Preservation**: Session-specific context and references
- **SQLite Storage**: Fast, reliable local storage
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Configurable retention policies
- **Conversation Memory**: AI remembers previous messages within a session

## Conversation Memory

Atmos AI now has **full conversation memory** within sessions. When you send a message, the AI receives the complete conversation history, enabling:

### How It Works

1. **Message History**: All previous messages (user and assistant) are stored in the session database
2. **Context Window**: When you send a message, the full conversation history is sent to the AI provider
3. **Multi-turn Conversations**: The AI can reference previous questions and answers
4. **Follow-up Questions**: You can ask "yes", "tell me more", or "what about that?" and the AI understands

### Example Conversations

**Example 1: Follow-up Questions**

<Terminal title="atmos ai chat --session vpc-design">
```bash
You: What are Atmos stacks?

AI: Atmos stacks are configuration files that define your infrastructure.
    They use inheritance and composition to share configuration across environments.
    For example, you might have a base stack with common settings, then specific
    stacks for dev, staging, and prod that inherit from the base.

You: yes

AI: Great! Since you understand stacks, let me explain how they work with components.
    # ✅ AI remembers it just explained stacks

You: can you show me an example for production?

AI: Sure! Based on the stack structure I explained, here's a production stack example:
    # ✅ AI references the earlier explanation
    [Shows YAML example with production values]

You: what about staging?

AI: For staging, you'd use a similar structure but with different values:
    # ✅ AI knows you want comparison to production
    [Shows staging example highlighting differences from production]
```
</Terminal>

**Example 2: Multi-Step Problem Solving**

<Terminal title="atmos ai chat --session rds-setup">
```bash
You: I need to set up RDS in production

AI: I'll help you set up RDS. First, let's plan the configuration:
    1. VPC and subnet selection
    2. Security groups
    3. Instance size and storage
    4. Backup and maintenance windows
    What VPC will this RDS instance be in?

You: use the prod-use1-network VPC

AI: Perfect, I'll use prod-use1-network. Now, what instance size do you need?
    # ✅ Remembers we're setting up RDS in prod-use1-network
    Options: db.t3.micro (dev), db.t3.medium (staging), db.r5.large (prod)

You: db.r5.large

AI: Good choice for production. I'm configuring:
    # ✅ Remembers: RDS, prod-use1-network VPC, db.r5.large
    - VPC: prod-use1-network
    - Instance: db.r5.large
    - Environment: production

    What's your preferred backup window? (off-peak hours recommended)

You: 2am to 4am UTC

AI: Excellent. Here's your complete RDS configuration:
    # ✅ Remembers all choices from the conversation
    [Shows complete YAML with all specified values]
```
</Terminal>

**Example 3: Session Continuity Across Days**

<Terminal title="atmos ai chat --session migration-plan">
```bash
# Day 1: Initial planning
You: We're migrating from 10.0.0.0/16 to 10.1.0.0/16

AI: I'll help plan this VPC migration. This is a significant change that will require:
    1. Creating the new VPC (10.1.0.0/16)
    2. Setting up VPC peering during transition
    3. Migrating resources incrementally
    4. Updating route tables and security groups
    5. Decommissioning the old VPC

    Should we start by planning the new VPC structure?

You: yes, let's define the subnets first

AI: For 10.1.0.0/16, I recommend this subnet layout:
    [Provides detailed subnet plan]

# Day 2: Resume session
atmos ai chat --session migration-plan

You: let's continue with the migration plan

AI: Welcome back! We were planning the VPC migration from 10.0.0.0/16 to 10.1.0.0/16.
    # ✅ Remembers the entire discussion from Day 1

    Yesterday we defined the subnet structure for the new VPC.
    Ready to plan the VPC peering setup for the transition period?

You: yes

AI: Based on the subnet plan we created yesterday:
    # ✅ Can reference specific details from previous session
    [Shows VPC peering configuration using the exact subnets discussed]

# Week later: Review decisions
atmos ai chat --session migration-plan

You: why did we choose /16 instead of /24?

AI: We chose /16 (65,536 IPs) to accommodate future growth.
    # ✅ Can recall reasoning from the original discussion
    In our initial planning, we discussed that /24 (256 IPs) would be too small
    for production workloads with plans to scale EKS nodes and additional services.
```
</Terminal>

### Benefits

- **Natural Conversations**: Talk to the AI like you would a colleague
- **No Repetition**: Don't need to repeat context in every message
- **Complex Workflows**: Build on previous answers to solve multi-step problems
- **Session Continuity**: Resume conversations days later with full context

### Technical Implementation

The conversation memory works across **all 7 AI providers**:
- ✅ **Anthropic** (Claude) - Full history support
- ✅ **OpenAI** (GPT) - Full history support
- ✅ **Google** (Gemini) - Full history support
- ✅ **xAI** (Grok) - Full history support
- ✅ **Ollama** (Local) - Full history support
- ✅ **AWS Bedrock** - Full history support
- ✅ **Azure OpenAI** - Full history support

Each provider receives messages in their native format while maintaining the same conversation experience.

:::info Privacy Note
When resuming a session, the complete message history is sent to the AI provider. If your conversations contain sensitive information, review the [Privacy and Security](#privacy-and-security) section below.

## Configuration

Enable sessions in your `atmos.yaml`:

<File title="atmos.yaml">
```yaml
settings:
  ai:
    enabled: true
    default_provider: "anthropic"
    providers:
      anthropic:
        model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
        api_key_env: "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"

    sessions:
      enabled: true                    # Enable persistent sessions
      storage: "sqlite"                # Storage backend (default: sqlite)
      path: ".atmos/sessions"          # Storage directory (default: .atmos/sessions)

</dl>

## Using Sessions

### Starting a Named Session

Start a new chat session with a specific name:

<Terminal title="atmos ai chat --session">
```bash
atmos ai chat --session vpc-refactor
```
</Terminal>

If the session doesn't exist, it will be created. If it exists, the conversation history will be loaded.

### Starting an Anonymous Session

If you don't provide a session name, a new anonymous session is created:

<Terminal title="atmos ai chat">
```bash
atmos ai chat
# Creates session with auto-generated name like: session-20250123-143022
```
</Terminal>

### Resuming an Existing Session

Resume a previous conversation by specifying its name:

<Terminal title="atmos ai chat --session">
```bash
# Continue your vpc-refactor conversation
atmos ai chat --session vpc-refactor
```
</Terminal>

The AI will have access to the complete conversation history, providing continuity and context.

### Managing Sessions in the TUI

While in an active chat session, you can manage sessions using built-in TUI features. The TUI provides an enhanced chat experience with:

- **Markdown Rendering**: AI responses displayed with rich formatting (bold, italic, lists, tables)
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Code blocks shown with language-specific highlighting
- **History Navigation**: Navigate previous messages with ↑/↓ arrow keys (like Bash history)
- **Multi-line Input**: Compose complex messages with `Shift+Enter`

See the [`atmos ai chat` documentation](/cli/commands/ai/chat) for details on all interactive features.

#### Creating New Sessions (Ctrl+N)

Create a new session without leaving the TUI:

<Terminal title="atmos ai chat">
```bash
# Press Ctrl+N to open the create session form
Ctrl+N
```
</Terminal>

The create session form allows you to:
- **Enter a custom session name** - Descriptive names help organize conversations
- **Select an AI provider** - Choose from 7 providers: cloud (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Grok), local (Ollama), or enterprise (Bedrock, Azure)
- **Pick the default model** - Each provider has its default model pre-selected

**Create Session Form Controls:**
- `Tab` - Switch between name input and provider selection
- `↑`/`↓` - Navigate provider options
- `Enter` - Create the session and start chatting
- `Esc` - Cancel and return to previous view

**Available Providers:**

2. Press `r` to enter rename mode
3. Edit the session name (pre-filled with current name)
4. Press `Enter` to save or `Esc` to cancel

**Rename Features:**
- **Inline editing** - Edit directly in the session picker
- **Pre-filled value** - Current name is pre-populated for easy editing
- **Validation** - Empty names are rejected
- **Live update** - If renaming the active session, the name updates immediately

#### Filtering Sessions by Provider (f key)

Filter sessions to show only those from a specific AI provider:

<Terminal title="atmos ai chat">
```bash
# Press Ctrl+L to open the session picker
Ctrl+L

# Press 'f' to cycle through provider filters
f  # Shows only Claude sessions
f  # Shows only GPT sessions
f  # Shows only Gemini sessions

<Terminal title="atmos ai sessions clean">
```bash
# Clean sessions older than 30 days
atmos ai sessions clean --older-than 30d

# Clean sessions older than 7 days
atmos ai sessions clean --older-than 7d

# Clean sessions older than 24 hours
atmos ai sessions clean --older-than 24h
```
</Terminal>

Example output:
```
🧹 Cleaning sessions older than 30 days...
✅ Deleted 5 sessions
```

Supported time units:
- `h` - hours (e.g., `24h`)
- `d` - days (e.g., `7d`)
- `w` - weeks (e.g., `2w`)
- `m` - months (e.g., `3m`)

## Session Storage

### How Sessions Are Stored

Atmos stores all your AI conversations **locally on your machine** in a lightweight SQLite database. When you chat with the AI, your messages and the AI's responses are automatically saved so you can continue conversations later.

**Storage Benefits:**
- ✅ **Fast & Efficient** - Optimized for quick access to conversation history
- ✅ **Fully Local** - All data stays on your computer, nothing sent to cloud storage
- ✅ **Automatic** - No manual saving required, conversations persist automatically
- ✅ **Portable** - Single database file you can backup, share, or move between machines

### Storage Location

Sessions are stored in a SQLite database file inside your project directory:

```
<project-root>/.atmos/sessions/sessions.db
```

**Example locations:**
```
~/infrastructure/.atmos/sessions/sessions.db          # Local project
/workspace/atmos-config/.atmos/sessions/sessions.db   # Team project
```

The database file is created automatically when you start your first session. You can customize the storage location in your `atmos.yaml` configuration:

```yaml
settings:
  ai:
    sessions:
      path: ".atmos/sessions"  # Default location
```

:::tip File System Performance
The session database uses Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mode for optimal performance. This means writes don't block reads, and you get fast response times even with long conversation histories.
:::

### What's Stored

Each session contains:
- **Your messages** - Everything you ask the AI
- **AI responses** - Complete conversation history
- **Session metadata** - Name, creation date, model, provider
- **Context references** - Links to stack files and components discussed

The database is optimized for performance with proper indexes on frequently accessed data, ensuring your chat experience remains fast even with hundreds of messages.

### Backing Up Sessions

To backup your sessions, simply copy the database file:

<Terminal title="shell">
```bash
# Backup sessions
cp .atmos/sessions/sessions.db .atmos/sessions/sessions.db.backup

# Restore from backup
cp .atmos/sessions/sessions.db.backup .atmos/sessions/sessions.db
```
</Terminal>

### Viewing Session Details

Use the built-in commands to view your sessions without needing to access the database directly:

<Terminal title="atmos ai sessions">
```bash
# List all sessions with metadata
atmos ai sessions

# View sessions in the interactive TUI
atmos ai chat
# Press Ctrl+L to see all sessions with details
```
</Terminal>

The session picker shows everything you need: session names, AI providers, creation dates, and message counts.

:::info Advanced Users
If you're comfortable with SQLite, you can query the database directly at `.atmos/sessions/sessions.db` using any SQLite client. However, we recommend using the built-in `atmos ai sessions` command for most use cases.
:::

## Privacy and Security

### Local Storage

Sessions are stored **locally on your machine** in the SQLite database. No session data is transmitted to AI providers except during active conversations.

### Session Data

Sessions contain:
- ✅ Your questions and the AI's responses
- ✅ Session metadata (name, timestamps, model)
- ✅ Context references (stack files, components)
- ❌ No API keys or credentials
- ❌ No data sent to AI providers unless actively chatting

### Data Sent to AI Providers

When you resume a session, the message history is sent to the AI provider to provide context. This happens:
- Only during active chat sessions
- Only for the specific session you're using
- According to your provider's data handling policies

**Important**: If your conversations contain sensitive information (AWS account IDs, infrastructure details), be aware that this data is sent to your AI provider.

### Deleting Sessions

To permanently delete a session:

<Terminal title="shell">
```bash
# Clean all sessions older than 0 days (delete all)
atmos ai sessions clean --older-than 0d

# Or manually delete the database
rm .atmos/sessions/sessions.db
```
</Terminal>

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

Use descriptive session names that reflect the topic:

<Terminal title="shell">
```bash
# Good session names
atmos ai chat --session vpc-refactor
atmos ai chat --session rds-troubleshooting
atmos ai chat --session new-region-setup

# Avoid generic names
atmos ai chat --session test
atmos ai chat --session temp
```
</Terminal>

### Session Organization

- **One Topic per Session**: Keep conversations focused on a single topic
- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear names that describe the conversation purpose
- **Regular Cleanup**: Clean old sessions regularly to avoid clutter
- **Important Sessions**: For critical sessions, backup the database file

### Retention Strategy

Choose retention based on your needs:

<File title="atmos.yaml">
```yaml
# For active development (keep recent sessions)
sessions:
  retention_days: 7

# For long-term projects (keep longer)
sessions:
  retention_days: 90

# Never auto-delete (manual cleanup only)
sessions:
  retention_days: 0
```
</File>

### Performance Optimization

For large repositories:

<File title="atmos.yaml">
```yaml
sessions:
  max_sessions: 20          # Increase if you need more active sessions
  auto_save: true           # Keep enabled for data safety
  retention_days: 30        # Clean up regularly to maintain performance
```
</File>

## Use Cases

### Long-term Infrastructure Projects

<Terminal title="shell">
```bash
# Start a session for a major refactoring project
atmos ai chat --session vpc-migration-2025

# Work on it over multiple days/weeks
# Each time you resume, the AI remembers the context

# Day 1: Planning
atmos ai chat --session vpc-migration-2025
> "Let's plan the VPC migration from 10.0.0.0/16 to 10.1.0.0/16"

# Day 2: Implementation
atmos ai chat --session vpc-migration-2025
> "Show me the plan we discussed yesterday"
# AI has full context of previous discussion

# Week 2: Troubleshooting
atmos ai chat --session vpc-migration-2025
> "We're seeing routing issues with the new VPC"
# AI can reference earlier conversations about the migration
```
</Terminal>

### Topic-Specific Sessions

<Terminal title="shell">
```bash
# Separate sessions for different concerns
atmos ai chat --session security-review
atmos ai chat --session performance-optimization
atmos ai chat --session cost-reduction
atmos ai chat --session dr-planning
```
</Terminal>

### Team Collaboration

<Terminal title="shell">
```bash
# Share session database with team
# Team members can view conversation history
sqlite3 .atmos/sessions/sessions.db .dump > session-export.sql

# Team member imports
sqlite3 .atmos/sessions/sessions.db < session-export.sql
```
</Terminal>

## Troubleshooting

### Session Not Found

If you get "session not found" errors:

<Terminal title="shell">
```bash
# List all sessions to verify the name
atmos ai sessions

# Check database exists
ls -la .atmos/sessions/sessions.db
```
</Terminal>

### Database Corruption

If you encounter database errors:

<Terminal title="shell">
```bash
# Check database integrity
sqlite3 .atmos/sessions/sessions.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"

# If corrupted, restore from backup
cp .atmos/sessions/sessions.db.backup .atmos/sessions/sessions.db

# Or start fresh (WARNING: deletes all sessions)
rm .atmos/sessions/sessions.db
```
</Terminal>

### Disk Space Issues

If sessions are consuming too much disk space:

<Terminal title="shell">
```bash
# Check database size
du -h .atmos/sessions/sessions.db

# Clean old sessions
atmos ai sessions clean --older-than 7d

# Vacuum database to reclaim space
sqlite3 .atmos/sessions/sessions.db "VACUUM;"
```
</Terminal>

### Permission Errors

If you get permission errors:

<Terminal title="shell">
```bash
# Check directory permissions
ls -la .atmos/sessions/

# Fix permissions
chmod 755 .atmos/sessions
chmod 644 .atmos/sessions/sessions.db
```
</Terminal>
