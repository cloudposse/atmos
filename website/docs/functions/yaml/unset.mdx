:::note Purpose
Use the `!unset` function to delete or remove keys from Atmos stack configurations during inheritance and merging. This allows you to explicitly remove values that were defined in parent configurations or imports.
:::

## Usage

The `!unset` function is a YAML explicit type that marks a key for deletion from the configuration. Unlike setting a value to `null` (which keeps the key with a null value), `!unset` completely removes the key from the configuration.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

<File title="stacks/base.yaml">
```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    vpc:
      vars:
        enable_nat_gateway: true
        enable_vpn_gateway: true
        availability_zones: ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b", "us-east-1c"]
```
</File>

<File title="stacks/dev.yaml">
```yaml
import:
  - base

components:
  terraform:
    vpc:
      vars:
        # Remove VPN gateway for dev environment
        enable_vpn_gateway: !unset

        # Override NAT gateway setting
        enable_nat_gateway: false
```
</File>

After processing, the `dev` stack will have:
- `enable_nat_gateway: false` (overridden)
- No `enable_vpn_gateway` key (removed by `!unset`)
- `availability_zones` inherited from base

### Removing Nested Values

<File title="stacks/config.yaml">
```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    app:
      vars:
        config:
          database:
            host: "prod.db.example.com"
            port: 5432
            ssl_mode: "require"
            backup_enabled: true
```
</File>

<File title="stacks/override.yaml">
```yaml
import:
  - config

components:
  terraform:
    app:
      vars:
        config:
          database:
            # Remove backup configuration for this environment
            backup_enabled: !unset

            # Keep other database settings
            host: "dev.db.example.com"
```
</File>

### Working with Lists

When used in arrays, `!unset` removes the item from the list:

<File title="stacks/example.yaml">
```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    security:
      vars:
        allowed_ports:
          - 80
          - 443
          - !unset  # This item will be removed from the list
          - 8080
```
</File>

The resulting `allowed_ports` will be `[80, 443, 8080]`.

## Use Cases

### 1. Environment-Specific Configuration

Remove production-only settings from development environments:

```yaml
# base.yaml - Contains all possible settings
monitoring:
  alerts:
    pagerduty: enabled
    email: enabled
    sms: enabled

# dev.yaml - Remove production alerting
monitoring:
  alerts:
    pagerduty: !unset  # Don't need PagerDuty in dev
    sms: !unset        # Don't need SMS alerts in dev
    email: enabled     # Keep email notifications
```

### 2. Feature Flags

Remove feature flags that aren't applicable to certain deployments:

```yaml
# defaults.yaml
features:
  experimental_feature: true
  beta_feature: true
  legacy_support: true

# modern-stack.yaml
features:
  legacy_support: !unset  # Remove legacy support entirely
```

### 3. Security Configuration

Remove sensitive configurations from non-production environments:

```yaml
# prod.yaml
security:
  vault_integration: true
  audit_logging: true
  compliance_mode: "strict"

# staging.yaml
import:
  - prod

security:
  compliance_mode: !unset  # Not needed in staging
  audit_logging: false      # Override to false
```

## How It Works

The `!unset` function operates at two levels:

1. **During YAML parsing**: When the YAML is initially parsed, keys marked with `!unset` are identified
2. **During merging**: When configurations are merged (through imports or inheritance), keys marked with `!unset` are removed from the target configuration

This ensures that the key is completely absent from the final configuration, not just set to `null` or an empty value.

## Comparison with Other Approaches

| Approach | Result | Use Case |
|----------|--------|----------|
| `key: !unset` | Key is completely removed | When you want the key to not exist |
| `key: null` | Key exists with `null` value | When you want to explicitly set null |
| `key: ""` | Key exists with empty string | When you want an empty value |
| Omitting the key | Key is inherited if defined in parent | Normal inheritance behavior |

## Important Notes

- `!unset` only affects the specific key it's assigned to
- It works with all Atmos configuration sections: `vars`, `settings`, `env`, `metadata`, etc.
- The function is processed after template rendering but before final merging
- You cannot "unset" a key that doesn't exist (no error is thrown, it's simply ignored)
- Works with all merge strategies (replace, append, merge)
