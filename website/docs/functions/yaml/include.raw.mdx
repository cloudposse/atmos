<Intro>
    The `!include.raw` function forces any file to be included as a raw string,
    bypassing automatic parsing based on file extension.
</Intro>

While the regular [`!include`](./include) function parses files based on their extension (JSON, YAML, HCL),
`!include.raw` always returns the file content as a plain string. This is useful when you need
the actual file content as text rather than parsed data structures.

## Usage

```yaml
vars:
  # Always injects content from file or URL as string
  json_string: !include.raw config.json
  yaml_string: !include.raw settings.yaml
  hcl_string: !include.raw terraform.tfvars
```

## Common Use Cases

### Template Files

Include template files that need to be processed later:

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    my-service:
      vars:
        # Kubernetes manifest template as string
        manifest_template: !include.raw k8s-deployment-template.yaml

        # JSON config template for interpolation
        config_template: !include.raw config-template.json

        # Terraform HCL template
        tf_template: !include.raw module-template.tf
```

### Documentation and Scripts

Include documentation or scripts as strings:

```yaml
metadata:
  # Include markdown documentation
  readme: !include.raw README.md
  changelog: !include.raw CHANGELOG.md

  # Include shell scripts
  install_script: !include.raw ./scripts/install.sh
  deploy_script: !include.raw ./scripts/deploy.sh
```

### Preserving Formatting

When you need to preserve the exact formatting of a file:

```yaml
vars:
  # Preserve JSON formatting for display or logging
  example_config: !include.raw example-config.json

  # Keep YAML with comments intact
  annotated_yaml: !include.raw annotated-config.yaml

  # Include HCL with original formatting
  terraform_example: !include.raw example.tf
```

### Configuration as Strings

When you need configuration files as strings for further processing:

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    app:
      vars:
        # Pass JSON config as string to Terraform
        json_config_string: !include.raw app-config.json

        # YAML config for base64 encoding
        yaml_config_string: !include.raw settings.yaml
```

## Remote Files

The `!include.raw` function works with all remote sources supported by `!include`:

```yaml
vars:
  # GitHub raw content
  remote_template: !include.raw https://raw.githubusercontent.com/org/repo/main/template.yaml

  # S3 bucket files
  s3_script: !include.raw s3://my-bucket/scripts/deploy.sh

  # Google Cloud Storage
  gcs_config: !include.raw gcs://my-bucket/configs/app.json

  # With query parameters (extension detection ignores query strings)
  versioned_template: !include.raw https://api.example.com/template.yaml?version=2
```

## Comparison with !include

| Function | File: `config.json` | Content | Result |
|----------|-------------------|---------|---------|
| `!include` | `config.json` | `{"key": "value"}` | Parsed JSON object: `{key: value}` |
| `!include.raw` | `config.json` | `{"key": "value"}` | Raw string: `'{"key": "value"}'` |

### Example

Given a file `config.json`:
```json
{
  "database": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 5432
  }
}
```

Using in a stack manifest:
```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    app:
      vars:
        # Parsed as JSON object
        config_parsed: !include config.json
        # Result: {database: {host: localhost, port: 5432}}

        # Raw string
        config_string: !include.raw config.json
        # Result: '{"database":{"host":"localhost","port":5432}}'
```

## YQ Expressions Not Supported

<Note>
The `!include.raw` function does not support YQ expressions since it always returns raw strings.
Use the regular `!include` function when you need to query structured data with YQ.
</Note>

```yaml
vars:
  # ❌ YQ expressions are not supported with !include.raw
  # This will fail - !include.raw does not process YQ expressions
  invalid: !include.raw config.json .database.host

  # ✅ Use regular !include for YQ expressions
  valid: !include config.json .database.host
```

## File Extension Handling

Unlike `!include` which uses file extensions to determine parsing behavior,
`!include.raw` completely ignores file extensions:

```yaml
vars:
  # All return raw strings regardless of extension
  json_raw: !include.raw data.json          # Raw string
  yaml_raw: !include.raw config.yaml        # Raw string
  hcl_raw: !include.raw terraform.tfvars    # Raw string
  text_raw: !include.raw readme.txt         # Raw string
  no_ext_raw: !include.raw LICENSE          # Raw string
```

## Supported Sources

The `!include.raw` function supports the same sources as `!include`:

### Local Files
- Absolute paths: `!include.raw /path/to/file.json`
- Relative paths: `!include.raw ../configs/settings.yaml`
- Base path relative: `!include.raw stacks/catalog/template.tf`

### Remote Files
- HTTP/HTTPS: `!include.raw https://example.com/config.json`
- S3: `!include.raw s3::https://bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/file.yaml`
- GCS: `!include.raw gcs::gs://bucket/path/file.hcl`
- Git: `!include.raw git::https://github.com/org/repo.git//file.txt?ref=v1.0.0`
