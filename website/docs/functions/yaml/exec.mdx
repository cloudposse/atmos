<Intro>
    The `!exec` Atmos YAML function is used to execute shell scripts and assign
    the results to the sections in Atmos stack manifests.
</Intro>

## Usage

```yaml
var1: !exec echo 42

var2: !exec get-data.sh

var3: !exec atmos terraform output <component> -s <stack> --skip-init -- -json test_label_id

var4: !exec atmos terraform output <component> -s {{ .stack }} --skip-init -- -json test_map

var5: !exec atmos terraform output <component> -s {{ .stack }} --skip-init -- -json test_list

var6: |
  !exec
    foo=0
    for i in 1 2 3; do
      foo+=$i
    done
    echo $foo
```

You can execute inline shell scripts, scripts defined in external files, or even Atmos or Terraform commands
(e.g. `!exec atmos terraform output`).

:::warning
`!exec atmos terraform output` is just as examples to show that you can get the outputs of an Atmos component using
the `!exec` YAML function, but it's not recommended to use.
Instead, use the [`!terraform.output`](/functions/yaml/terraform.output)
YAML function. It produces the same results, correctly handles complex types (lists and maps),
has a much simpler syntax, and automatically caches the results for the same component and stack (so if you are calling
it many times on the same component in the same stack, it will execute `terraform output` only once and the stack
processing will be much faster)
:::

The result of a script execution can be a simple type (string, number, or boolean), in which case Atmos
assigns it without modification.

If the result is a complex type (list, map or object), the script must return it as a JSON-encoded string.
After receiving the JSON-encoded string, Atmos automatically decodes it into the corresponding YAML complex type.

:::info
Atmos uses the [`interp`](https://pkg.go.dev/mvdan.cc/sh/v3@v3.10.0/interp) `Go` package to execute the shell scripts
in the `!exec` YAML function.

Package `interp` implements an interpreter that executes shell programs.
It aims to support POSIX and to behave like Bash, but it does not support all of its features.
:::

:::tip
You can use [Atmos Stack Manifest Templating](/core-concepts/stacks/templates) in the `!exec` YAML function expressions.
Atmos processes the templates first, and then executes the `!exec` function, allowing you to provide the parameters to
the function dynamically.

## Deferred Evaluation During Merge

Atmos uses **deferred evaluation** when processing YAML functions during configuration merging. This prevents type conflicts that can occur when inheriting and overriding values across multiple stack layers.

### The Problem: Type Conflicts

Without deferred evaluation, mixing concrete values and YAML functions in the inheritance chain would cause errors:

```yaml
# Base catalog (catalog/app/defaults.yaml)
components:
  terraform:
    my-app:
      vars:
        build_number: "1.0.0"  # Concrete string value

# Environment override (stacks/prod/app.yaml)
components:
  terraform:
    my-app:
      vars:
        build_number: !exec cat VERSION  # YAML function - different type!
```

In this scenario, Atmos would attempt to merge a string (`"1.0.0"`) with a YAML function reference during the configuration merge process, resulting in a type mismatch.

### The Solution: Deferred Merge

Atmos now **defers the evaluation** of YAML functions (including `!exec`, `!terraform.output`, `!terraform.state`, `!template`, `!store`, `!store.get`, and `!env`) until after all configuration layers have been merged. This three-phase approach eliminates type conflicts:

1. **Defer Phase** - YAML functions are identified and temporarily replaced with placeholders
2. **Merge Phase** - All configuration layers merge without type conflicts
3. **Evaluate Phase** - YAML functions are evaluated and applied to the final merged result

With deferred evaluation, the example above works seamlessly. The YAML function in the override layer is deferred during merge, then evaluated after merging completes, correctly replacing the base value.

### Benefits

- **Flexible Configuration Patterns** - Mix static values and YAML functions across inheritance layers without conflicts
- **Gradual Migration** - Migrate from static to dynamic configurations incrementally
- **Team Collaboration** - Different teams can use different approaches (static vs. templated) in their layers
- **Multi-Environment Support** - Use static values in dev/staging and YAML functions in production
