<Intro>
    The `!cwd` Atmos YAML function retrieves the current working directory where Atmos is executed from.
</Intro>

## Usage

The `!cwd` function can be called with or without a relative path:

```yaml
# Get the current working directory
base_path: !cwd

# Get CWD joined with a relative path
base_path: !cwd ./relative/path
```

## Why Use `!cwd`

By default, relative paths in `atmos.yaml` (like `.` and `..`) are resolved relative to the config file location, not where you run the command. This follows the convention of other config files like `tsconfig.json` and `package.json`.

Use `!cwd` when you need paths relative to where Atmos is executed, such as:

- Running Atmos from within a component directory with a shared config
- Dynamic path resolution based on the current directory
- Scripts that change directories before running Atmos

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```yaml
# atmos.yaml
# base_path will be set to the current working directory
base_path: !cwd
```

### With Relative Path

```yaml
# atmos.yaml
# base_path will be CWD + ./components
base_path: !cwd ./components
```

### Component-Relative Execution

A common use case is running Atmos from within a component directory while pointing to a shared configuration:

```bash
# Repository structure:
# /repo/
#   atmos.yaml          # shared config with base_path: !cwd
#   components/terraform/vpc/
#     main.tf

# When running from within a component:
cd /repo/components/terraform/vpc
ATMOS_CLI_CONFIG_PATH=/repo atmos terraform plan vpc -s prod

# base_path resolves to /repo/components/terraform/vpc (the CWD)
```

## Comparison with Other Path Options

| Configuration | Resolves to | Use when |
|---------------|-------------|----------|
| `base_path: "."` | Config file directory | Paths should be relative to atmos.yaml |
| `base_path: !cwd` | Current working directory | Paths should be relative to where you run from |
| `base_path: !repo-root` | Git repository root | Paths should be relative to repo root |
| `base_path: ""` | Git root with fallback to config dir | Smart default behavior |
