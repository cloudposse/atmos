<Intro>
    The `!env` Atmos YAML function is used to retrieve environment variables
    and assign them to the sections in Atmos stack manifests.
</Intro>

## Usage

The `!env` function can be called with either one or two parameters:

```yaml
  # Get the value of an environment variable.
  # If the environment variable is not present in the environment, `null` will be assigned
  !env <env-var-name>

  # Get the value of an environment variable.
  # If the environment variable is not present in the environment, the `default-value` will be assigned
  !env <env-var-name> <default-value>
```

## Arguments

<dl>
    <dt>`env-var-name`</dt>
    <dd>
        Environment variable name
    </dd>

    <dt>`default-value`</dt>
    <dd>(Optional) Default value to use if the environment variable is not present in the environment</dd>
</dl>

If the function is called with one argument (the name of the environment variable), and the environment variable is
not present, `null` will be assigned to the corresponding section in the Atmos manifest.

If the function is called with two arguments (the name of the environment variable and the default value), and the
environment variable is not present, the default value will be assigned to the corresponding section in the Atmos manifest.

## Examples

```yaml
vars:
  # `api_key` will be set to `null` if the environment variable `API_KEY` is not present in the environment
  api_key: !env API_KEY
  # `app_name` will be set to the default value `my-app` if the environment variable `APP_NAME` is not present in the environment
  app_name: !env APP_NAME my-app

settings:
  # `provisioned_by_user` will be set to `null` if the environment variable `ATMOS_USER` is not present in the environment
  provisioned_by_user: !env ATMOS_USER
```

## Handling default values with spaces

If you need to provide default values with spaces, enclose them in double quotes and use single quotes around the whole expression.

For example:

```yaml
  # `app_name` will be set to the default value `my app` if the environment variable `APP_NAME` is not present in the environment
  app_name: !env 'APP_NAME "my app"'

  # `app_description` will be set to the default value `my app description` if the environment variable `APP_DESCRIPTION` is not present in the environment
  app_description: !env 'APP_DESCRIPTION "my app description"'
```

**Handling Nested Quotes**

If your default value contains both single and double quotes, wrap the entire function call in single quotes while keeping any required double quotes inside the expression:

```yaml
# Use single quotes to wrap expressions containing double quotes
config_path: !env 'CONFIG_PATH "/etc/app/config.json"'

# Keep default values with mixed quotes readable by surrounding the expression with single quotes
api_endpoint: !env 'API_URL "https://api.example.com/v1"'
```

:::tip
Detailed escaping guidance (including bracket-notation examples) lives in the [!terraform.output documentation](/functions/yaml/terraform.output#handling-yq-expressions-with-bracket-notation-and-quotes). The same rules apply to `!env` because all YAML functions share the parser.
:::

:::tip
You can use [Atmos Stack Manifest Templating](/core-concepts/stacks/templates) in the environment variable names and default values when calling the `!env` YAML function.
Atmos processes the templates first, and then executes the `!env` function, allowing you to provide the parameters to
the function dynamically.
