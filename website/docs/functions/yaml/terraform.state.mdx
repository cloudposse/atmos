<Intro>
The `!terraform.state` YAML function allows reading the outputs ([remote state](/core-concepts/share-data/remote-state))
of components in Atmos stack manifests directly from the configured [Terraform/OpenTofu backends](/core-concepts/components/terraform/backends).
</Intro>

:::warning
Currently, the `!terraform.state` YAML function supports the following backend types:
- `local` ([Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/local) and [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/docs/language/settings/backends/local))
- `s3` ([Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/s3) and [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/docs/language/settings/backends/s3))

As support for new backend types is added (e.g. `azurerm`, `gcs`), this document will be updated accordingly.

Meanwhile, if you are using backends other than `local` and `s3`, consider the [__`!store`__](/functions/yaml/store)
or [__`!terraform.output`__](/functions/yaml/terraform.output) YAML function to read remote state
and [share data between components](/core-concepts/share-data).
:::

## Usage

The `!terraform.state` function can be called with either two or three parameters:

```yaml
  # Get the `output` of the `component` in the current stack
  !terraform.state <component> <output>

  # Get the `output` of the `component` in the provided `stack`
  !terraform.state <component> <stack> <output>

  # Get the output of the `component` by evaluating the YQ expression
  !terraform.state <component> <yq-expression>

 # Get the output of the `component` in the provided `stack` by evaluating the YQ expression
  !terraform.state <component> <stack> <yq-expression>
```

## Arguments

<dl>
  <dt>`component`</dt>
  <dd>Atmos component name</dd>

  <dt>`stack`</dt>
  <dd>(Optional) Atmos stack name</dd>

  <dt>`output` or `yq-expression`</dt>
  <dd>Terraform output or [YQ](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq) expression to evaluate the output</dd>
</dl>


:::tip
You can use [Atmos Stack Manifest Templating](/core-concepts/stacks/templates) in the `!terraform.state` YAML function expressions.
Atmos processes the templates first, and then executes the `!terraform.state` function, allowing you to provide the parameters to
the function dynamically.
:::

## `!terraform.state` Function Execution Flow

When processing the `!terraform.state` YAML function for a component in a stack, Atmos executes the following steps:

- **Stack and Component Context Resolution**
Atmos resolves the full context for the specified component within the given stack, including all inherited and merged
configuration layers (globals, environment and component-level config).

- **Terraform State Backend Lookup and Read**
Based on the resolved context, Atmos identifies the corresponding backend for the component in the stack
and reads the state file directly from the backend. If access to the backend requires a role assumption
(e.g. `assume_role.role_arn` for the `s3` backend), Atmos assumes the role before accessing the backend state file.

- **Output Parsing and Interpolation**
The relevant output variable is extracted from the state file (using a [YQ](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/) parser).
Atmos parses and interpolates the value into the final configuration structure, replacing the `!terraform.state`
directive in the YAML stack manifest with the final value.

:::tip
The `!terraform.state` function accepts the same parameters and produces the same result as the
[`!terraform.output`](/functions/yaml/terraform.output) function, but has significantly less impact
on performance as it reads the state file directly from the configured backend without executing Terraform/OpenTofu
commands, generating varfiles and backend config files, and initializing all modules and providers.

To understand the performance implications of the `!terraform.output` and `!terraform.state` functions,
compare the [!terraform.output Execution Flow](/functions/yaml/terraform.output#terraformoutput-function-execution-flow) with the
[!terraform.state Execution Flow](/functions/yaml/terraform.state#terraformstate-function-execution-flow).

## Using YQ Expressions to retrieve items from complex output types

To retrieve items from complex output types such as maps and lists, or do any kind of filtering or querying,
you can utilize [YQ](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq) expressions.

For example:

- Retrieve the first item from a list

```yaml
subnet_id1: !terraform.state vpc .private_subnet_ids[0]
```

- Read a key from a map

```yaml
username: !terraform.state config .config_map.username
```

For more details, review the following docs:

- [YQ Guide](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq)
- [YQ Recipes](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/recipes)

## Using YQ Expressions to provide a default value

If the component for which you are reading the output has not been provisioned yet, the `!terraform.state` function
will return `null`, unless you specify a [default value](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/operators/alternative-default-value)
in the YQ expression, in which case the function will return the default value.

This will allow you to mock outputs when executing `atmos terraform plan` where there are dependencies between components,
and the dependent components are not provisioned yet.

:::note
To provide a default value, you use the `//` YQ operator.
The whole YQ expression contains spaces, and to make it a single parameter, you need to double-quote it.

YQ requires the strings in the default values to be double-quoted as well.
This means that you have to escape the double-quotes in the default values by using two double-quotes.
:::

For example:

- Specify a string default value.
  Read the `username` output from the `config` component in the current stack.
  If the `config` component has not been provisioned yet, return the default value `default-user`

```yaml
username: !terraform.state config ".username // ""default-user"""
```

- Specify a list default value.
  Read the `private_subnet_ids` output from the `vpc` component in the current stack.
  If the `vpc` component has not been provisioned yet, return the default value `["mock-subnet1", "mock-subnet2"]`

```yaml
subnet_ids: !terraform.state vpc ".private_subnet_ids // [""mock-subnet1"", ""mock-subnet2""]"
```

- Specify a map default value.
  Read the `config_map` output from the `config` component in the current stack.
  If the `config` component has not been provisioned yet, return the default value `{"api_endpoint": "localhost:3000", "user": "test"}`

```yaml
config_map: !terraform.state 'config ".config_map // {""api_endpoint"": ""localhost:3000"", ""user"": ""test""}"'
```

For more details, review the following docs:

- [YQ Alternative (Default value)](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/operators/alternative-default-value)

## Using YQ Expressions to modify values returned from the remote state

Since the `output` parameter of the `!terraform.state` function is a [YQ](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq) expression,
you can use [YQ pipes](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/operators/pipe) and
[YQ operators](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/operators) (including [YQ string concatenation functions](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/operators/add#string-concatenation)
and [YQ arithmetic functions](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/operators/add))
to modify the values returned from the remote state.

For example, suppose you have an `aurora-postgres` Atmos component which has the output `master_hostname`.

To read the output without modification, you can use the following expressions:

```yaml
postgres_url: !terraform.state aurora-postgres master_hostname
```

```yaml
postgres_url: !terraform.state aurora-postgres .master_hostname
```

To prepend and append strings to the output, you can use YQ pipes and the `add` function (`+` operator):

```yaml
postgres_url: !terraform.state aurora-postgres ".master_hostname | ""jdbc:postgresql://"" + . + "":5432/events"""
```

:::note
The double quotes are required around the whole YQ expression, and around the strings inside the YQ expression,
hence the double-double quotes `""` to escape it.
:::

After the `!terraform.state` function is executed, the `postgres_url` variable will have the final value similar to:

```yaml
postgres_url: "jdbc:postgresql://aurora-postgres-cluster-writer.prod.plat.mydomain.net:5432/events"
```

For more details, review the following docs:

- [YQ pipe](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/operators/pipe)
- [YQ operators](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/operators)
- [YQ string concatenation](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/operators/add#string-concatenation)
- [YQ `add` function](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/operators/add)

## Examples

    my_lambda_component:
      vars:
        vpc_config:
          # Output of type string

          # Output of type list
          subnet_ids: !terraform.state vpc private_subnet_ids
          # Use a YQ expression to get an item from the list
          subnet_id1: !terraform.state vpc .private_subnet_ids[0]
          # Output of type map
          config_map: !terraform.state config {{ .stack }} config_map
          # Use a YQ expression to get a value from the map
          username: !terraform.state config .config_map.username
```

## Specifying Atmos `stack`

If you call the `!terraform.state` function with three parameters, you need to specify the stack as the second argument.

There are multiple ways you can specify the Atmos stack parameter in the `!terraform.state` function.

### Hardcoded Stack Name

Use it if you want to get an output from a component from a different (well-known and static) stack.
For example, you have a `tgw` component in a stack `plat-ue2-dev` that requires the `vpc_id` output from the `vpc` component from the stack `plat-ue2-prod`:

```yaml title="plat-ue2-dev"
  components:
    terraform:
      tgw:
        vars:
          vpc_id: !terraform.state vpc plat-ue2-prod vpc_id
```

### Reference the Current Stack Name

Use the `.stack` (or `.atmos_stack`) template identifier to specify the same stack as the current component is in
(for which the `!terraform.state` function is executed):

```yaml
  !terraform.state <component> {{ .stack }} <output>
  !terraform.state <component> {{ .atmos_stack }} <output>
```

For example, you have a `tgw` component that requires the `vpc_id` output from the `vpc` component in the same stack:

```yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      tgw:
        vars:
          vpc_id: !terraform.state vpc {{ .stack }} vpc_id
```

:::note
Using the `.stack` or `.atmos_stack` template identifiers to specify the stack is the same as calling the `!terraform.state`
function with two parameters without specifying the current stack, but without using `Go` templates.
If you need to get an output of a component in the current stack, using the `!terraform.state` function with two parameters
is preferred because it has a simpler syntax and executes faster.
:::

### Use a Format Function

Use the `printf` template function to construct stack names using static strings and dynamic identifiers.
This is convenient when you want to override some identifiers in the stack name:

```yaml
  !terraform.state <component> {{ printf "%s-%s-%s" .vars.tenant .vars.environment .vars.stage }} <output>

  !terraform.state <component> {{ printf "plat-%s-prod" .vars.environment }} <output>

  !terraform.state <component> {{ printf "%s-%s-%s" .settings.context.tenant .settings.context.region .settings.context.account }} <output>
```

<dl>
  <dt>`<component>`</dt>
  <dd>Placeholder for an actual component name (e.g. `vpc`)</dd>
  <dt>`<output>`</dt>
  <dd>Placeholder for an actual Terraform output (e.g. `subnet_ids`)</dd>
</dl>


For example, you have a `tgw` component deployed in the stack `plat-ue2-dev`. The `tgw` component requires the
`vpc_id` output from the `vpc` component from the same environment (`ue2`) and same stage (`dev`), but from a different
tenant `net` (instead of `plat`):

```yaml title="plat-ue2-dev"
  components:
    terraform:
      tgw:
        vars:
          vpc_id: !terraform.state vpc {{ printf "net-%s-%s" .vars.environment .vars.stage }} vpc_id
```

:::tip Important
    By using the `printf "%s-%s-%s"` function, you are constructing stack names using the stack context variables/identifiers.

    For more information on Atmos stack names and how to define them, refer to `stacks.name_pattern` and `stacks.name_template`
    sections in [`atmos.yaml` CLI config file](/cli/configuration/)
:::


## Caching the result of `!terraform.state` function

Atmos caches (in memory) the results of `!terraform.state` function.

The cache is per Atmos CLI command execution, e.g., each new execution of a command like `atmos terraform plan`,
`atmos terraform apply` or `atmos describe component` will create and use a new memory cache, which involves re-reading the remote state after reinitialisation.

If you define the function in stack manifests for the same component in a stack more than once, the first call will
produce the result and cache it, and all the consecutive calls will just use the cached data. This is useful when you use the
`!terraform.state` function for the same component in a stack in multiple places in Atmos stack manifests.
It will speed up the function execution and stack processing.

For example:

<File>
```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    test2:
      vars:
        tags:
          test: !terraform.state test id
          test2: !terraform.state test id
          test3: !terraform.state test {{ .stack }} id
```
</File>

In the example, the `test2` Atmos component uses the outputs (remote state) of the `test` Atmos component from the same stack.
The YAML function `!terraform.state` is executed three times (once for each tag).

After the first execution, Atmos caches the result in memory,
and reuses it in the next two calls to the function. The caching makes the stack processing much faster.
In a production environment where many components are used, the speedup can be significant.

## Using `!terraform.state` with `static` remote state backend

Atmos supports [brownfield configuration by using the remote state of type `static`](/core-concepts/components/terraform/brownfield/#hacking-remote-state-with-static-backends).

For example:

<File title="stack.yaml">
```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    # Component `static-backend` is configured with the remote state backend of type `static`
    static-backend:
      remote_state_backend_type: static
      remote_state_backend:
        static:
          region: "us-west-2"
          cluster_name: "production-cluster"
          vpc_cidr: "10.0.0.0/16"
          database:
            type: "postgresql"
            version: "12.7"
            storage_gb: 100
          allowed_ips:
            - "192.168.1.0/24"
            - "10.1.0.0/16"
          tags:
            Environment: "production"
            Owner: "infra-team"

    eks-cluster:
      vars:
        region: !terraform.state static-backend region
        cluster_name: !terraform.state static-backend cluster_name
        vpc_cidr: !terraform.state static-backend vpc_cidr
        db_type: !terraform.state static-backend database.type
        db_storage: !terraform.state static-backend database.storage_gb
        allowed_ips: !terraform.state static-backend allowed_ips
        tags: !terraform.state static-backend tags
```
</File>

When the functions are executed, Atmos detects that the `static-backend` component has the `static` remote state configured,
and instead of executing `terraform output`, it just returns the static values from the `remote_state_backend.static` section.

Executing the command `atmos describe component eks-cluster -s <stack>` produces the following result:

<Terminal title="atmos describe component eks-cluster -s <stack>">
```yaml
vars:
  region: us-west-2
  cluster_name: production-cluster
  vpc_cidr: 10.0.0.0/16
  db_type: postgresql
  db_storage: 100
  allowed_ips:
    - 192.168.1.0/24
    - 10.1.0.0/16
  tags:
    Environment: production
    Owner: infra-team
```
</Terminal>

## Considerations

 - Using `!terraform.state` with secrets can expose sensitive data to standard output (stdout) in any commands that describe stacks or components.

 - When using `!terraform.state` with [`atmos describe affected`](/cli/commands/describe/affected), Atmos requires access to all referenced remote states.
  If you operate with limited permissions (e.g., scoped to `dev`) and reference production stacks, the command will fail.

 - Overusing the function within stacks to reference multiple components can impact performance.

 - Be mindful of disaster recovery (DR) implications when using it across regions.

 - Consider cold-start scenarios: if the dependent component has not yet been provisioned, `terraform output` will fail.
