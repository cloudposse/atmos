<Intro>
Atmos provides powerful functions for manipulating data and performing operations in your stack configurations. These functions are divided into two categories: YAML Functions for use directly in YAML configurations, and Template Functions for use within Go template expressions.
</Intro>

## Function Categories

### YAML Functions

YAML functions use explicit typing with tags denoted by the exclamation point (`!`) symbol. They are processed when Atmos loads and parses stack manifests.

Common YAML functions include:
- [`!terraform.output`](/functions/yaml/terraform.output) - Access Terraform outputs
- [`!terraform.state`](/functions/yaml/terraform.state) - Read state directly from backends
- [`!store`](/functions/yaml/store) - Read values from external stores
- [`!include`](/functions/yaml/include) - Include external files
- [`!template`](/functions/yaml/template) - Process Go templates
- [`!env`](/functions/yaml/env) - Access environment variables

### Template Functions

Template functions are used within Go template expressions (enclosed in `{{ }}`) and provide programmatic access to Atmos data and operations.

Key template functions include:
- [`atmos.Component`](/functions/template/atmos.Component) - Access component configurations
- [`atmos.Store`](/functions/template/atmos.Store) - Read from external stores
- [`atmos.GomplateDatasource`](/functions/template/atmos.GomplateDatasource) - Access Gomplate datasources

## When to Use Each Type

**Use YAML Functions when:**
- You need to inject external data directly into YAML configurations
- The operation should happen during YAML parsing
- You want simple, declarative syntax
- Working with stack manifests and component configurations

**Use Template Functions when:**
- You need complex logic or transformations
- Working with Go template expressions
- You need to combine multiple operations
- Creating dynamic configurations based on conditions

## Performance Considerations

- **`!terraform.state`** is faster than `!terraform.output` as it reads directly from backends without initializing Terraform
- **`!store`** functions cache results for better performance
- Template functions may add latency when accessing remote resources
- Consider using `!store` for frequently accessed values
