<Intro>
Atmos supports the ability to take action at various points in the lifecycle of your components. This is done by
configuring the `hooks` section in your stack manifest for the component that you want to take action on.
</Intro>


## Hooks Schema

The `hooks` section schema is as follows:

```yaml
hooks:
  store-outputs:
    events:
      - after-terraform-apply
    command: store
    name: prod/ssm
    outputs:
      vpc_id: .id
```

This schema can be specified at the top level of the stack configuration (global), within the `terraform` section,
inside individual components, or in the `overrides` section. Partial config can also be specified at various levels
to help keep the configuration [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).

#### An example demonstrating this concept is below:

At the global level, set that the store command will run after terraform apply:

```yaml
# stacks/catalog/vpc/_defaults.yaml (global)
hooks:
  store-outputs:
    events:
      - after-terraform-apply
    command: store
```
In the production account, use the `prod/ssm` store (configured in atmos.yaml):

```yaml
# stacks/orgs/acme/plat/prod/_defaults.yaml (terraform)
terraform:
  hooks:
    store-outputs:
      name: prod/ssm
```

At the component level, specify that the `id` output of the component should be stored in the store as the `vpc_id` key:

```yaml
# stacks/orgs/acme/plat/prod/us-east-2.yaml (component)
components:
  terraform:
    vpc:
      hooks:
        store-outputs:
          outputs:
            vpc_id: .id
```

## Supported Lifecycle Events

Atmos supports the following lifecycle events:

- `after-terraform-apply` (this event is triggered after the `atmos terraform apply` or `atmos terraform deploy` command is run)

## Supported Commands

## store

The `store` command is used to write data to a remote store.

<dl>
  <dt>`hooks.[hook_name]`</dt>
  <dd>This map key is the name you want to give to the hook. This must be unique for each hook in the component.</dd>

  <dt>`hooks.[hook_name].events`</dt>
  <dd>
  This is a list of [Supported Lifecycle Events](#supported-lifecycle-events) that should trigger running the command.
  </dd>

  <dt>`hooks.[hook_name].command`</dt>
  <dd>Must be set to `store`</dd>

  <dt>`hooks.[hook_name].name`</dt>
  <dd>The name of the store to use.</dd>

<dt>`hooks.[hook_name].outputs`</dt>
  <dd>
  A map of values that will be written to the store under the key for this component. The key is the name of the key in
  the store. The value is the value to write to the store. If the value begins with a dot (`.`), it will be treated as a
  [Terraform output](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/outputs) and the value will be retrieved
  from the Terraform state for the current component.
