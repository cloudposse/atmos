<Intro>
Here are some essential best practices to follow when designing architectures using infrastructure as code (IaC), focusing on optimizing
component design, reusability, and lifecycle management. These guidelines are designed to help developers and operators build efficient,
scalable, and reliable systems, ensuring a smooth and effective infrastructure management process.

Also, be sure to review the [Terraform Best Practices](/best-practices/terraform) for additional guidance on using Terraform with Atmos.

## Keep Your Components Small to Reduce the Blast Radius of Changes

Focus on creating single purpose components that small, reusable components that adhere to the UNIX philosophy by doing one thing well.
This strategy leads to simpler updates, more straightforward troubleshooting, quicker plan/apply cycles, and a
clearer separation of responsibilities. Best of all, your state remains small and complexity remains manageable.

Anti-patterns to avoid include:
- Combining VPCs with databases in the same component
- Defining every dependency needed by an application in a single component (provided there's no shared lifecycle)

## Split Components By Lifecycle

To keep your component small, consider breaking them apart by their Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).
Things that always change together, go together. Things that seldom change together, should be managed separately.
Keep the coupling loose, and use remote state for cohesion.

For instance, a VPC, which is rarely destroyed, should be managed separately from more dynamic resources like clusters
or databases that may frequently scale or undergo updates.

## Make Them Opinionated, But Not Too Opinionated

Ensure components are generalized to prevent the proliferation of similar components, thereby promoting easier testing,
reuse, and maintenance.

:::important Don't Treat Components like Child Modules
Don't force users to use generic components if that will radically complicate the configuration.
The goal is to make 80% of your infrastructure highly reusable with generic single purpose components.
The remaining 20% might need to be specialized for your use case, and that's okay.
:::

## Avoid Single Resource Components

If you find yourself writing a component that is so small, it manages only a single resource e.g. (an IAM Policy),
consider if it should be part of a larger component.

:::tip Stack Configurations are Not a Replacement for Terraform
The biggest risk for newcomers to Atmos is to over architect components into extremely DRY single-purpose components.
Stack configurations in YAML should not just be a proxy for terraform resources.

Use terraform for its strengths, compliment it with YAML when it makes sense for very straight forward configuration.
:::


## Use Parameterization, But Avoid Over-Parameterization

Good parameterization ensures components are reusable, but components become difficult to test and document with too many parameters.

Often time, child modules might accept more parameters than the root module. You can always add more parameters to the root module
as needed, but it's hard to remove them once they are there.

## Avoid Creating Factories Inside of Components

[Factories are common software design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_(object-oriented_programming)) that allow you
to create multiple instances of a component.

To minimize the blast radius of changes and maintain fast plan/apply cycles, do not embed factories within components that
provision lists of resources.

Examples of anti-patterns include:
- Reading a configuration file inside of Terraform to create multiple Buckets
- Using a `for_each` loop to create multiple DNS records from a variable input
  (you may hit rate limits when you zones get large enough; it's happened to us)

Instead, leverage [Stack configurations to serve as factories](/learn/stacks) for provisioning multiple component instances.
This approach keeps the state isolated and scales efficiently with the increasing number of component instances.

Please note, it's perfectly fine to use `for_each` loops sometimes to provision groups of resources, just use them with moderation
and be aware of the potential downsides, such as creating massive states with a wide blast radius. For example, maybe you can safely manage a collection of resources this way.

:::note Do as we say, not as we do
It is with humility that we state this best practice. Even many of our own Cloud Posse components, do not follow this because
they were written before we realized the overwhelming benefits of this approach.

## Use Components Inside of Factories

Google discusses the "factories" approach in the post [Resource Factories: A descriptive approach to Terraform](https://medium.com/google-cloud/resource-factories-a-descriptive-approach-to-terraform-581b3ebb59c). This concept is familiar to every major programming framework, and you can apply it to Terraform too.

However, unlike Google's approach of creating the factory inside the component ([which we don't recommend](#avoid-creating-factories-inside-of-components)), we suggest using the stack configuration as the factory and the component as the product.

By following this method, you create a single component for a specific purpose, such as a VPC, database, or Kubernetes cluster. Then, you can instantiate multiple instances of that component in your stack configuration.

In the factory pattern, the component acts like the "factory class," and when defined in the stack configuration, it is used to create and configure multiple component instances.

A component provides specific functionality but is not responsible for its own instantiation or configuration; this responsibility is delegated to the factory.

This approach decouples your architecture from the configuration, resulting in smaller state files and independent lifecycle management for each instance. Most importantly, it maximizes the reusability of your components.


## Use Component Libraries & Vendoring

Utilize a centralized [component library](/components/components-overview) to distribute and share components across the
organization efficiently. This approach enhances discoverability by centralizing where components are stored, preventing
sprawl, and ensuring components are easily accessible to everyone. Employ vendoring to retrieve remote dependencies, like
components, ensuring the practice of immutable infrastructure.

## Organize Related Components with Folders

Organize multiple related components in a common folder. Use nested folders as necessary, to logically group components.
For example, by grouping components by cloud provider and layer (e.g. `components/terraform/aws/network/<vpc>`)

## Document Component Interfaces and Usage

Utilize tools such as [terraform-docs](https://terraform-docs.io) to thoroughly document the input variables and outputs
of your component. Include snippets of stack configuration to simplify understanding for developers on integrating the component
into their stack configurations. Providing examples that cover common use-cases of the component is particularly effective.

## Version Components for Breaking Changes

Use versioned folders within the component to delineate major versions (e.g. `/components/terraform/<something>/v1/`)

## Use a Monorepo for Your Components

For streamlined development and simplified dependency management, smaller companies should consolidate stacks and components
in a single monorepo, facilitating easier updates and unified versioning. Larger companies and enterprises with multiple monorepos
can benefit from a central repository for upstream components, and then use vendoring to easily pull in these shared components to
team-specific monorepos.

## Maintain Loose Coupling Between Components

Avoid directly invoking one component from within another to ensure components remain loosely coupled. Specifically for Terraform
components (root modules), this practice is unsupported due to the inability to define a backend in a child module, potentially
leading to unexpected outcomes. It's crucial to steer clear of this approach to maintain system integrity.

## Reserve Code Generation as an Escape Hatch for Emergencies

We generally advise against using code generation for application logic (components), because it's challenging to ensure good test
coverage (e.g. with `terratest`) and no one likes to code review machine-generated boilerplate in Pull Requests.

If you find yourself in a situation that seems to require code generation, take a step back and consider if that's the right approach.
- Do not code generate providers to [overcome "limitations" in Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/19932#issuecomment-1817043906),
  for example, to iterate over providers. This is a red flag. Instead, architect your components to work with a single provider
- If you are programmatically combining several child modules, consider if they should instead be separated by lifecycle.

When you follow these rules, root modules become highly reusable, and you reduce the amount of state managed by a single component,
and therefore, the blast radius of changes.

## Separate Your State by Region

For Disaster Recovery purposes, always strive to keep the state of your components separate by region.
You don't want a regional outage to affect your ability to manage infrastructure in other regions.

## Limit Providers to One or Two Per Component

Avoid using multiple providers in a single component, as it reduces the reusability of the component and increases
the complexity and blast radius of what it manages.

Consider instead "hub" and "spoke" models, where each spoke is its own component with its own lifecycle.
In this model, the "spoke" will usually have two providers, one for the current context and one for the "hub."
