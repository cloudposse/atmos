## Common Mistakes

* Running out of date version of `atmos` with newer configuration parameters
* An `atmos.yaml` with incorrect `stacks.stack_name` pattern (often due to copy pasta)

## Common Errors

Here are some common errors that can come up.

### Error: `stack name pattern must be provided`

```console
stack name pattern must be provided in 'stacks.name_pattern' config or 'ATMOS_STACKS_NAME_PATTERN' ENV variable
```

This means that you are probably missing a section like this in your `atmos.yml`. See the instructions on CLI Configuration for more details.

```yaml
stacks:
  name_pattern: "{tenant}-{environment}-{stage}"
```

### Error: `The stack name pattern ... does not have a tenant defined`

```console
The stack name pattern '{tenant}-{environment}-{stage}' specifies 'tenant', but the stack ue1-prod does not have a tenant defined
```

This means that your `name_pattern` declares a `tenant` is required, but not specified in the Stack configurations. Either specify a `tenant` in
your `vars` for the Stack configuration, or remove the `{tenant}` from the `name_pattern`.

```yaml
stacks:
  name_pattern: "{tenant}-{environment}-{stage}"
```

### Error: `depends_on expected a map, got slice`

```console
decoding: depends_on expected a map, got slice
```

The `depends_on` functionality originally existed only under `settings.spacelift.depends_on` and was a list of other components that the current
component depends on.

We have since updated `depends_on` to be more generic and be directly under `settings.depends_on` (so it can also be used in GitHub Actions and other
tools).

The updated key is now a map (rather than a list). If you see this error, it means that someone put a `depends_on`
block directly under `settings` but added it as a list (rather than a map as the new config requires).

The solution is to move it under `settings.spacelift.depends_on` (legacy, deprecated, not recommended) or update the dependencies to be a map.

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    top-level-component2:
      metadata:
        component: "top-level-component1"
      settings:
        spacelift:
          workspace_enabled: false
        depends_on:
          1:
            # If the `context` (namespace, tenant, environment, stage) is not provided,
            # the `component` is from the same Atmos stack as this component
            component: "test/test-component"
          2:
            # If the `context` (namespace, tenant, environment, stage) is not provided,
            # the `component` is from the same Atmos stack as this component
            component: "test/test2/test-component-2"
          3:
            file: "examples/tests/components/terraform/mixins/introspection.mixin.tf"
          4:
            folder: "examples/tests/components/helmfile/infra/infra-server"
      vars:
        enabled: true
```
