# Unreleased Content

<Intro>
This page lists documentation that contains content not yet included in a formal release. The features or changes described may be available in the development version but are pending an official release.
</Intro>

## What "Unreleased" Means

Pages marked as unreleased indicate that:

- **Portions of the content, or possibly the entire page**, may refer to functionality that has not yet been released
- **The documentation was recently updated** and those changes are not yet associated with a stable release
- **Releases happen on a weekly cadence** — you can expect these changes to be associated with a formal release soon

Once a release is published that includes the documented changes, the "Unreleased" badge will automatically be removed.
