<Intro>
Architecting and provisioning enterprise-grade infrastructure is challenging, and making all the components and
configurations [reusable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusability) and [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) is even more difficult. These Atmos Design Patterns can help with structuring and organizing your design to provision multi-account enterprise-grade environments for complex organizations.
</Intro>

We've already identified and documented many Atmos Design Patterns.
You may be wondering, "Where do I begin and what steps should I follow?"

Here are some recommendations.

### Quick Start Repository Introduction

This [Quick Start](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/tree/main/examples/quick-start-advanced) repository presents an example of an infrastructure managed
by Atmos. You can clone it and configure to your own needs. The repository should be a good start to get yourself familiar with Atmos and the
Design Patterns. The [Quick Start Guide](/quick-start) describes the steps required to configure and start using the repository.

The [Atmos Quick Start](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/tree/main/examples/quick-start-advanced) repository, that is described in
the [Quick Start](/quick-start) guide, uses the following Atmos Design Patterns:

- [Organizational Structure Configuration](/design-patterns/organizational-structure-configuration)
- [Component Catalog](/design-patterns/component-catalog)
- [Partial Component Configuration](/design-patterns/partial-component-configuration)
- [Inline Component Customization](/design-patterns/inline-component-customization)


### Development and Exploration with Atmos

If you are just developing or kicking the tires on Atmos, you can use any of the Design Patterns described in this guide, and find out which ones
are best suited to your requirements. The easiest ones to get started with will be:

  - [Inline Component Configuration](/design-patterns/inline-component-configuration)
  - [Inline Component Customization](/design-patterns/inline-component-customization)

### Advanced Infrastructure Architecture

If you are architecting the infrastructure to provision multi-account multi-region environments at scale, we suggest you start with the
  following Design Patterns:

  - [Organizational Structure Configuration](/design-patterns/organizational-structure-configuration)
  - [Component Catalog](/design-patterns/component-catalog)
  - [Inline Component Customization](/design-patterns/inline-component-customization)
  - [Component Inheritance](/design-patterns/component-inheritance)
  - [Abstract Component](/design-patterns/abstract-component)
  - [Multiple Component Instances](/design-patterns/multiple-component-instances)
  - [Partial Component Configuration](/design-patterns/partial-component-configuration)
  - [Layered Stack Configuration](/design-patterns/layered-stack-configuration)
