We view this collection of Design Patterns as neither exhaustive nor fixed. Instead, it serves as a documentation of our present ideas, insights and
knowledge. Your input, whether in the form of comments, critiques, references, or suggestions for Design Patterns we may have overlooked, is highly
encouraged and appreciated.

This Quick Start guide describes the steps to configure and provision the infrastructure
from this [Quick Start](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/tree/master/examples/quick-start) repository.

You can clone it and configure to your own needs. The repository should be a good start to get yourself familiar with Atmos.
