<Intro>
**Folder-Based Versioning** is the foundational folder organization approach within [Continuous Version Deployment](/design-patterns/version-management/continuous-version-deployment). Components are organized in simple, explicit folders (`vpc/`, `eks/`, `rds/`) on the main branch. What you see is what you get—no magic, no hidden versioning. This straightforward structure makes divergence visible and patching any version straightforward.
</Intro>

This is the recommended starting point for most teams and what most components use. The explicit folder structure provides clarity: you can see at a glance which components exist and how they're organized. All subsequent folder organization approaches ([Release Tracks/Channels](/design-patterns/version-management/release-tracks-channels) and [Strict Version Pinning](/design-patterns/version-management/strict-version-pinning)) build on this foundation.

<KeyPoints>
- No magic: what you see in the folder structure is what you get
- Explicit divergence visibility through folder organization
- Straightforward patching—modify the component folder directly
- Foundation that other folder organization approaches build upon
- Clear separation between different components
</KeyPoints>

## Use Cases

Use the **Folder-Based Versioning** pattern when:

- You need **significant component rework** that will take time to stabilize
- You want **explicit version boundaries** visible in the repository
- You need to **run multiple versions side-by-side** for extended periods
- You're making **breaking changes** that require careful migration
- You want **clear separation** between stable and experimental code
- You need **gradual migration paths** for complex components

## Problem

Major component changes often require extended development periods and careful migration strategies. Traditional versioning approaches can create challenges:

- **In-place changes** destabilize existing deployments
- **Feature flags** add complexity and technical debt
- **Branch-based development** delays integration and feedback
- **Hidden versioning** makes it hard to understand what's deployed where

Folder-Based Versioning addresses these issues by making versions first-class citizens in the repository structure.

## Solution

Create separate folders for each major version of a component. Environments explicitly reference the folder containing their desired version, making version selection transparent and reversible.

### Core Principles

1. **Versions as Folders**: Each major version gets its own directory
2. **Explicit References**: Stacks explicitly choose which folder/version to use
3. **Parallel Development**: Multiple versions can evolve independently
4. **Stable State Keys**: Workspace keys remain constant across version switches
5. **Clear Deprecation**: Old versions are clearly marked and eventually removed

## Implementation

### Directory Structure

Organize components with version-specific folders:

<File title="Directory Structure">
```text
components/
  terraform/
    vpc/
      v1/                   # Version 1 implementation
        main.tf
        variables.tf
        outputs.tf
        README.md
      v2/                   # Version 2 implementation
        main.tf
        variables.tf
        outputs.tf
        README.md
        MIGRATION.md        # Migration guide from v1
      v3-preview/           # Version 3 in development
        main.tf
        variables.tf
        outputs.tf
        README.md
    rds/
      standard/             # Standard RDS version
        main.tf
      aurora/               # Aurora variant
        main.tf
      v2-deprecated/        # Deprecated version
        main.tf
        DEPRECATED.md
```
</File>

### Stack Configuration

Environments reference specific version folders:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="dev" label="Development" default>
<File title="stacks/dev/us-east-1.yaml">
```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    vpc:
      metadata:
        component: vpc/v2  # Reference v2 folder for development
      settings:
        # CRITICAL: Don't include version in workspace key
        workspace_key_prefix: "vpc"
      vars:
        name: "dev-use1-vpc"
        cidr_block: "10.0.0.0/16"
```
</File>
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="prod" label="Production">
<File title="stacks/prod/us-east-1.yaml">
```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    vpc:
      metadata:
        component: vpc/v1  # Production still on stable v1
      settings:
        # Same workspace key as dev - enables migration
        workspace_key_prefix: "prod/vpc"
      vars:
        name: "prod-use1-vpc"
        cidr_block: "10.2.0.0/16"
```
</File>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Version Naming Conventions

Choose clear, consistent naming patterns within your component folders:

<File title="components/terraform directory structure">
```text
components/
  terraform/
    vpc/
      v1/                    # Semantic versioning
      v2/
      v3-preview/

    rds/
      standard/              # Feature-based versioning
      aurora/
      serverless/

    eks/
      stable/                # Release-channel versioning
      beta/
      deprecated/

    lambda/
      2023/                  # Date-based versioning
      2024/
      2025/
```
</File>

## Workspace Key Management

:::warning Workspace Key Configuration
This pattern works best with Atmos auto-generated [backend configuration](/components/terraform/backends). The `workspace_key_prefix` must remain stable across version changes to prevent state conflicts:

```yaml
# WRONG - Version in workspace key causes state problems
settings:
  workspace_key_prefix: "prod/vpc/v2"  # Don't do this!

# CORRECT - Stable workspace key across versions
settings:
  workspace_key_prefix: "prod/vpc"     # Version-agnostic key
```

When the workspace key includes version information, switching versions requires complex state migrations. Keep it stable!
:::

## Migration Strategies

### Gradual Migration

Roll out new versions progressively through environments:

<File title="migration-plan.yaml">
```yaml
# Week 1: Development environments
dev:
  vpc:
    metadata:
      component: vpc/v2

# Week 2: Staging environments
staging:
  vpc:
    metadata:
      component: vpc/v2

# Week 3: Production canary
prod-canary:
  vpc:
    metadata:
      component: vpc/v2

# Week 4: All production
prod:
  vpc:
    metadata:
      component: vpc/v2
```
</File>

### In-Place Upgrade

For backwards-compatible changes, switch the folder reference:

```bash
# Before upgrade - verify current state
atmos terraform plan vpc --stack prod-us-east-1

# Update stack configuration to point to new version
# Edit: metadata.component from "vpc/v1" to "vpc/v2"

# Plan with new version - should show intended changes
atmos terraform plan vpc --stack prod-us-east-1

# Apply the upgrade
atmos terraform apply vpc --stack prod-us-east-1
```

## Rollback Strategy

Folder-based versioning makes rollback trivial - just switch the folder reference:

### Update Stack Configuration

```yaml
# stacks/prod/us-east-1.yaml
components:
  terraform:
    vpc:
      metadata:
        # Rollback from v2 to v1
        component: vpc/v1  # Was: vpc/v2
      settings:
        workspace_key_prefix: "prod/vpc"  # Keep stable!
```

### Validate and Apply

```bash
# Validate the rollback
atmos terraform plan vpc --stack prod-us-east-1

# Review the changes - should show reverting to v1 behavior

# Apply the rollback
atmos terraform apply vpc --stack prod-us-east-1
```

:::tip Zero-Downtime Rollback
Since the old version folder still exists unchanged, rollback is instantaneous and risk-free. The stable workspace key means no state migration is needed.
:::

### Rollback Verification

```bash
# Quick sanity check - verify stack config points to correct folder
atmos describe component vpc --stack prod-us-east-1 | grep "component:"
# Should show: component: vpc/v1

# TRUE VERIFICATION - plan should show no changes
atmos terraform plan vpc --stack prod-us-east-1
# Should output: No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.
```

The "no changes" output proves that the rollback was successfully applied to the infrastructure, not just the configuration.

## Benefits

The **Folder-Based Versioning** approach provides:

- **No Magic**: What you see in the folder structure is exactly what you get—no hidden versioning mechanisms or complex abstractions
- **Explicit Divergence**: When components diverge (e.g., creating `vpc/v2` alongside `vpc/`), it's immediately visible in the repository structure
- **Straightforward Patching**: Need to patch a component? Modify the folder directly. No need to track down version references or update manifests
- **Foundation for Extensions**: Provides the base that [Release Tracks](/design-patterns/version-management/release-tracks-channels) and [Strict Version Pinning](/design-patterns/version-management/strict-version-pinning) build upon
- **Clear Organization**: Component structure is self-documenting through the folder hierarchy
- **Safe Experimentation**: New versions can be developed in separate folders without affecting existing deployments
- **Gradual Migration**: Environments can switch folders at their own pace

## Drawbacks

The pattern also has limitations:

- **Repository Growth**: Multiple versions increase repository size
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Bug fixes may need to be applied to multiple versions
- **Potential Confusion**: Developers must understand which version to modify
- **Code Duplication**: Similar code exists in multiple folders
- **Cleanup Discipline**: Deprecated versions must be actively removed

## Best Practices

- **Version Lifecycle Management:** Define clear lifecycle stages for component versions including Preview (experimental, API unstable), Beta (feature complete, testing in progress), Stable (production ready), Deprecated (marked for removal), and Archived (no longer maintained). Document transition criteria and timelines between stages.

  <File title="docs/version-lifecycle.md">
  ```markdown
  # Component Version Lifecycle

  ## Stages
  1. **Preview** (-preview suffix): Experimental, API unstable
  2. **Beta** (-beta suffix): Feature complete, testing in progress
  3. **Stable** (no suffix or -v2): Production ready
  4. **Deprecated** (-deprecated suffix): Marked for removal
  5. **Archived** (moved to archive/): No longer maintained

  ## Transitions
  - Preview → Beta: After API stabilization
  - Beta → Stable: After production validation
  - Stable → Deprecated: When newer version is stable
  - Deprecated → Archived: After all migrations complete

  ## Timeline
  - Minimum 30 days in Beta before Stable
  - Minimum 90 days Deprecated before removal
  - Document migration path before deprecation
  ```
  </File>

- **Version Documentation:** Maintain clear documentation for each version including a component version matrix showing status (Stable, Beta, Preview, Deprecated) and version-specific notes with deprecation dates and migration guidance.

- **Shared Code Management:** Minimize duplication by using shared modules that can be imported by multiple versions, reducing maintenance burden while allowing version-specific variations.

- **Testing Strategy:** Test all active versions using Atmos validation commands to ensure each version continues to function correctly as the codebase evolves.

- **Migration Process:** Migrate components to new versions by updating stack configuration to reference the new version folder, then preview and apply changes using Atmos terraform commands.

## Drawbacks and Trade-offs

While Folder-Based Versioning provides clear benefits, consider these trade-offs:

### Code Duplication
**Multiple copies** of similar code exist across version folders with considerable overlap, requiring updates in multiple locations when applying security patches or bug fixes to older versions still in use.

### Divergence Risk
When versions evolve independently over extended periods, environments can **drift significantly** from each other, making it difficult to reason about the overall system state and increasing the likelihood of environment-specific issues.

### Release Tracking Challenge
Git commits record when code changes were **merged**, not when they were **deployed** to environments. Without additional tooling or documentation, it's challenging to determine which version of a component is actually running in which environment at any given time. Git shows the history of the code, not the deployment state.

## Summary

Folder-Based Versioning provides explicit, visible version management through repository structure. It excels when you need to maintain multiple versions in parallel, make breaking changes safely, or provide clear migration paths. While it can increase repository size and maintenance overhead, the clarity and safety it provides often outweigh these costs, especially for critical infrastructure components.

:::tip Key Takeaway
Folder-based versioning makes version boundaries explicit and migrations reversible. It's ideal for major version changes that require extended development and careful rollout strategies.
