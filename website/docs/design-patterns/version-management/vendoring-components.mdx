<PillBox>Atmos Design Pattern</PillBox>
<Intro>
**Vendoring Component Versions** is a complementary technique that automates copying component versions from multiple external sources into your repository. This works with any deployment strategy—[Continuous Version Deployment](/design-patterns/version-management/continuous-version-deployment) or [Git Flow](/design-patterns/version-management/git-flow-branches-as-channels)—and can be combined with any folder organization approach.
</Intro>

Vendoring gives teams local control over external dependencies by bringing component code in-house while maintaining metadata about origin and lineage. Whether you use [Folder-Based Versioning](/design-patterns/version-management/folder-based-versioning), [Release Tracks](/design-patterns/version-management/release-tracks-channels), or [Strict Version Pinning](/design-patterns/version-management/strict-version-pinning), vendoring provides predictable update cycles and the ability to apply custom modifications when necessary.

<KeyPoints>
- Why Atmos makes explicit what other tools do implicitly (just-in-time cloning)
- Operational benefits: visibility, audit trail, emergency agility, explicit divergence
- Developer experience benefits: searchability, readability, IDE support
- How to converge with upstream when it makes sense and diverge when needed
- The pragmatic approach that emerged from countless projects
</KeyPoints>

## Philosophy: Explicit Over Implicit

Most tools that "pin to remote sources" actually do this behind the scenes:
1. Clone the remote source to a temporary folder (just-in-time vendoring)
2. Point Terraform/tooling at that temporary folder
3. Clean up the folder after execution

**Atmos makes this process explicit:**
1. Vendor upstream components with `atmos vendor pull`
2. Commit the vendored code to your repository
3. Pin components to those vendored folders
4. Update vendored code on your schedule

The result is functionally the same, but with critical advantages for operations and developer experience.

### Why We Vendor: Lessons from Countless Projects

This approach emerged from real operational pain across countless projects. We tried pure remote sourcing—it created productivity blockers:

**The Coordination Nightmare:**
Cross-cutting changes required opening dozens of PRs across multiple repositories. If you discovered a problem at any step, you started over. Or you took shortcuts (pinning to branches instead of versions), creating technical debt to clean up later.

**The Developer Experience Problem:**
When everything is a remote reference, developers can't search the codebase for definitions, IDE navigation breaks ("Go to definition" fails), and understanding requires dereferencing dozens of sources. The cognitive overhead compounds quickly.

**The Emergency Response Problem:**
Security patches get blocked waiting for upstream review and release cycles. When minutes matter, multi-repository coordination kills agility.

**Pure DRY leads to complexity rashes.** The pragmatic approach: vendor explicitly, converge with upstream when it makes sense, diverge when you need to.

## Benefits of Explicit Vendoring

### Operational Benefits

**Visibility via Git Diff:**
When you update vendored dependencies, `git diff` shows the actual code changes—not just version number bumps. This makes code review meaningful and catches breaking changes before deployment.

**Immutable Audit Trail:**
Every vendored update is a commit in your repository. You have a complete, immutable record of what code ran when, satisfying compliance requirements without additional tooling.

**Emergency Agility:**
Need to patch a vulnerability? Make changes directly in the vendored folder and deploy immediately. No waiting for upstream PRs, reviews, or release cycles. Re-sync with upstream when the dust settles.

**Explicit Divergence Signaling:**
When you need to diverge from upstream (emergency patches, business-specific changes), disable the vendoring config for that component. This clearly signals to your team: "we've intentionally diverged here."

### Developer Experience Benefits

**Searchable Codebase:**
`grep` and IDE search work across all vendored components. Finding where something is defined takes seconds, not minutes of jumping between repositories.

**Readable Code:**
Open files and understand implementation without dereferencing remote sources. The code is right there, readable and navigable.

**IDE Functionality Works:**
"Go to definition", "Find references", and other IDE features work across vendored components. Developer tools function as intended.

**Reduced Cognitive Load:**
No constant context switching to external repositories. Everything needed to understand the system is in one place.

**Better Onboarding:**
New team members can explore the actual code to learn how things work, not just read abstract documentation or hunt through remote references.

## Use Cases

Use the **Vendoring Components** pattern when:

- You need **predictable update windows** for third-party components
- **Compliance requirements** mandate code auditing and approval
- You need to **apply custom patches** to upstream components
- **Network restrictions** limit access to external repositories
- You want **resilience against upstream availability** issues
- You need **consistent versioning** across all environments without external dependencies
- **Upstream cadence** doesn't match your release schedule

## Problem

Direct dependencies on external repositories create several challenges:

- **Upstream Breaking Changes**: Unexpected changes can break deployments
- **Availability Risks**: External sources may become unavailable
- **Audit Challenges**: Difficult to review all code changes in external dependencies
- **Timing Mismatches**: Upstream release schedules may not align with your needs
- **Patching Limitations**: Cannot modify external code without forking
- **Network Dependencies**: Requires internet access during deployment

Vendoring addresses these issues by bringing code under local control while maintaining traceability.

## Solution

Copy external component code into your repository with clear metadata about its origin, version, and any local modifications. Use Atmos's vendor command to manage the process systematically.

### Core Principles

1. **Local Copies**: All external code is copied into your repository
2. **Origin Tracking**: Maintain metadata about where code came from
3. **Bulk Updates**: Update multiple components together in controlled windows
4. **Intentional Divergence**: Clearly mark and track local modifications
5. **Audit Trail**: Document all vendor updates and changes

## Implementation with Atmos

Atmos provides built-in vendoring support through the `vendor.yaml` manifest and `atmos vendor` command.

### Basic Vendor Configuration

<File title="vendor.yaml">
```yaml
# Vendor manifest for component management
apiVersion: atmos/v1

        - "test/**"
        - ".github/**"

    # Vendor with custom branch
    - component: eks
      source: "github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-eks-cluster.git///?ref={{.Version}}"
      version: "main"
      targets:

### Advanced Vendor Configuration

<File title="vendor.yaml">
```yaml
apiVersion: atmos/v1
kind: AtmosVendorConfig
metadata:
  name: component-vendoring

spec:
  # Global settings
  settings:
    # Base path for all vendored components
    base_path: "components/terraform"

  # Component sources with mixins
  sources:
    # Vendor multiple versions of the same component
    - component: vpc
      source: "github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc.git///?ref={{.Version}}"
      targets:
        - path: "vpc/{{.Version}}"
          version: "2.1.0"
        - path: "vpc/latest"
          version: "2.2.0"

      tags:
        - production
        - critical
      # Only vendor if tags match
      condition: "production"
```
</File>

### Tracking Vendored Components

The `vendor.yaml` file serves as your vendor manifest, documenting all component sources and versions:

<File title="vendor.yaml (vendor manifest)">
```yaml
# Vendor manifest tracking all component sources and versions
apiVersion: atmos/v1
kind: AtmosVendorConfig
metadata:
  name: infrastructure-components
  description: Vendor manifest for infrastructure components

spec:
  sources:
    # VPC component - specific version
    - component: vpc
      source: "github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc.git///?ref={{.Version}}"
      version: "2.1.0"
      targets:
        - "components/terraform/vpc"
      included_paths:
        - "**/*.tf"
        - "**/*.tfvars"
        - "README.md"
      tags:
        - networking
        - production

    # EKS component - specific version
    - component: eks
      source: "github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-eks-cluster.git///?ref={{.Version}}"
      version: "4.0.0"
      targets:
        - "components/terraform/eks"
      included_paths:
        - "**/*.tf"
        - "**/*.tfvars"
      excluded_paths:
        - "test/**"
        - "examples/**"
      tags:
        - kubernetes
        - production

    # RDS component from private repository
    - component: rds
      source: "git::ssh://git@github.com/acme/terraform-modules.git//rds?ref={{.Version}}"
      version: "v3.5.0"
      targets:
        - "components/terraform/rds"
      tags:
        - database
        - production
```
</File>

:::note Version Tracking
The `vendor.yaml` file IS your vendor manifest. It tracks:
- **Source repository** and exact version for each component
- **Target location** where the component is vendored
- **Included/excluded paths** to control what gets vendored
- **Tags** for organizing and filtering components

To see what version is currently vendored, check the `vendor.yaml` file.
:::

## Vendoring Workflow

### 1. Initial Vendoring

```bash
# Pull all configured components
atmos vendor pull

# Pull specific component
atmos vendor pull --component vpc

# Pull with specific version override
atmos vendor pull --component vpc --version 2.2.0

# Dry run to see what would be vendored
atmos vendor pull --dry-run
```

### 2. Tracking Local Modifications

When making local changes to vendored components:

<File title="components/terraform/vpc/LOCAL_MODIFICATIONS.md">
```markdown
# Local Modifications

This component has been vendored from github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc

## Modifications

### 2024-01-21: Compliance Tags
- **File**: main.tf
- **Author**: john.doe@example.com
- **Reason**: Added required compliance tags per security policy
- **Changes**: Added compliance_tags to locals with DataClassification, ComplianceLevel, and LastReviewed fields

### 2024-01-25: Custom Security Groups
- **File**: security-groups.tf (new file)
- **Author**: jane.smith@example.com
- **Reason**: Added organization-specific security group rules
- **Note**: This file is not present in upstream

## Update Instructions

When updating from upstream:
1. Save local modifications: `git stash`
2. Vendor update: `atmos vendor pull --component vpc`
3. Reapply modifications: `git stash pop`
4. Resolve any conflicts
5. Test thoroughly
6. Update this document
```
</File>

### 3. Bulk Updates

Perform controlled bulk updates using Atmos vendor commands:

```bash
# Update all vendored components
atmos vendor pull

# Update specific component
atmos vendor pull --component vpc

# Update with specific version
atmos vendor pull --component vpc --version v2.2.0

# Dry run to preview changes
atmos vendor pull --dry-run
```

Track vendor updates in your vendor manifest:

```yaml
# vendor.yaml - Update component version
spec:
  sources:
    - component: vpc
      source: "github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc.git///?ref={{.Version}}"
      version: "2.2.0"  # Updated from 2.1.0
      targets:
        - "components/terraform/vpc"
```

### 4. Handling Divergence

When intentionally diverging from upstream:

<File title="vendor.yaml">
```yaml
spec:
  sources:
    - component: vpc
      source: "github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc.git///?ref={{.Version}}"
      version: "2.1.0"
      targets:
        - "components/terraform/vpc"
      # Document divergence in comments
      # DIVERGED: Custom modifications for multi-region support
      # See LOCAL_MODIFICATIONS.md for details
      # Manual review required for any updates
```
</File>

## Diverging from Upstream

When you need to diverge from upstream (emergency patches, business-specific changes), Atmos provides a clear path:

**1. Make Local Changes:**
Edit the vendored component directly in your repository. The changes are immediately visible in git diff.

**2. Disable Vendoring for That Component:**
Comment out or remove the component from `vendor.yaml` to signal intentional divergence:

<File title="vendor.yaml">
```yaml
spec:
  sources:
    # DIVERGED: vpc component has custom security patches
    # See components/terraform/vpc/LOCAL_MODIFICATIONS.md
    # - component: vpc
    #   source: "github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc.git///?ref={{.Version}}"
    #   version: "2.1.0"
    #   targets:
    #     - "components/terraform/vpc"
```
</File>

**3. Document the Divergence:**
Create a `LOCAL_MODIFICATIONS.md` file in the component directory explaining what changed and why.

**4. Reconverge When Ready:**
When upstream incorporates your changes or you're ready to drop local modifications:
- Re-enable the vendoring config
- Run `atmos vendor pull` to sync with upstream
- Review and resolve any conflicts

This explicit workflow ensures divergence is visible, documented, and intentional—not hidden or accidental.

## Drawbacks

The pattern also has limitations:

- **Maintenance Burden**: You own security patches and bug fixes
- **Repository Size**: Vendored code increases repository size
- **Update Lag**: May fall behind upstream improvements
- **Merge Complexity**: Reconciling local changes with updates
- **Tooling Requirements**: Need processes for vendor management

## Best Practices

### 1. Maintain Clear Lineage

Always document in vendor.yaml where code came from:

```yaml
# Track all component sources in vendor.yaml
spec:
  sources:
    - component: vpc
      source: "github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc.git///?ref={{.Version}}"
      version: "2.1.0"
      # Use comments to document any local modifications
      # Modified: Added compliance tags, custom security groups
```

### 2. Regular Update Cycles

Schedule regular vendor updates:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/vendor-update.yml
name: Vendor Update Check
on:
  schedule:
    # Every Monday at 9 AM
    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  check-updates:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Atmos
        uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos@v2
      - name: Check for Vendor Updates
        run: |
          # Check vendor status
          atmos vendor status

      - name: Create Issue if Updates Available
        run: |
          # Create issue if updates are available
          if atmos vendor status --check-updates; then
            atmos vendor status --format=markdown > vendor-report.md
            gh issue create \
              --title "Vendor Updates Available: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)" \
              --body-file vendor-report.md \
              --label "vendor-update"
          fi
```

### 3. Document Divergence

Clearly document why and how you've diverged:

```markdown
# Divergence Documentation

## Component: VPC
**Diverged**: Yes
**Date**: 2024-01-21
**Reason**: Compliance requirements

### Changes Made:
1. Added mandatory compliance tags
2. Modified security group rules
3. Added custom outputs for monitoring

### Update Strategy:
- Manual review required
- Cannot auto-update due to custom changes
- Patches must be manually applied

### Future Plans:
- Working with upstream to incorporate changes
- Target convergence: Q2 2024
```

### 4. Test Vendored Components

Maintain tests for vendored components:

```bash
# Test vendored components
for component in components/terraform/*; do
  echo "Testing $component..."
  cd $component
  terraform init
  terraform validate
  tflint
  tfsec .
  cd -
done
```

### 5. Security Scanning

Regularly scan vendored code:

```bash
# Security scanning workflow
- name: Security Scan
  run: |
    # Scan for vulnerabilities
    trivy fs components/terraform/

    # Check for secrets
    gitleaks detect --source=components/terraform/

    # Terraform security
    tfsec components/terraform/
```

## Rollback Strategy

Vendoring provides multiple rollback approaches:

### Option 1: Revert to Previous Vendored Version

```bash
# Check Git history for the vendored component
git log --oneline components/terraform/vpc/

# Revert to a previous commit
git checkout <previous-commit> -- components/terraform/vpc/

# Or use Git to revert the vendor pull
git revert <vendor-update-commit>

# Validate the rollback
atmos validate component vpc --stack prod-us-east-1

# Apply the rollback
atmos terraform apply vpc --stack prod-us-east-1
```

### Option 2: Re-vendor Previous Version

```yaml
# vendor.yaml - Specify the previous version
spec:
  sources:
    - component: vpc
      source: "github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc.git"
      version: "2.0.0"  # Was 2.1.0, rolling back
      targets:
        - "components/terraform/vpc"
```

```bash
# Re-vendor the previous version
atmos vendor pull --component vpc

# This will overwrite local changes - use with caution!
```

### Option 3: Use Version Control for Rollback

```bash
# If vendored components are committed to Git
git diff HEAD~1 components/terraform/vpc/ # Review changes
git checkout HEAD~1 -- components/terraform/vpc/ # Rollback
```

:::warning Local Modifications
If you have local modifications, ensure they're preserved during rollback or reapplied afterward.
:::

## Migration Strategies

### To Vendoring from Direct References

1. **Inventory External Dependencies**: List all external module references
2. **Create Vendor Configuration**: Define sources in vendor.yaml
3. **Initial Vendoring**: Run `atmos vendor pull`
4. **Update Stack References**: Change from external URLs to local paths
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure vendored version produces same results
6. **Document Origin**: Update vendor.yaml with source information

### From Vendoring to Other Patterns

If moving away from vendoring:

1. **To Direct References**: Update source URIs to point to external repositories
2. **To Release Tracks**: Organize vendored components into track folders
3. **To Folder Versioning**: Rename vendored folders with version suffixes

## Summary

Vendoring Components provides maximum control over external dependencies at the cost of increased maintenance responsibility. It's ideal for organizations with strict compliance requirements, those needing predictable update windows, or teams that must maintain custom patches. While it increases repository size and maintenance burden, the benefits of local control, audit capability, and resilience often justify these trade-offs for critical infrastructure components.

:::tip Key Takeaway
Vendoring is about taking ownership of your dependencies. Use it when external code is critical to your infrastructure and you need full control over when and how it changes.
