<Intro>
**Git Flow: Branches as Channels** is the branch-based deployment strategy alternative to [Continuous Version Deployment](/design-patterns/version-management/continuous-version-deployment). Instead of trunk-based deployment, long-lived branches map to release channels with environments tracking specific branches and promotions happening through merges. Uses simple [Folder-Based Versioning](/design-patterns/version-management/folder-based-versioning) since branches serve as the versioning mechanism.

:::info Idiomatic Versioning for Git Flow
Git Flow idiomatically uses **[Environment Names](/design-patterns/version-management/versioning-schemes#environment-names)** because **branches ARE the environments** (`channels/dev`, `channels/staging`, `channels/prod`).

It doesn't make sense to use number-based schemes (SemVer, CalVer) or other label-based schemes (Maturity Levels) with Git Flow—branches carry the version semantics through the merge/promotion flow. The branch name itself indicates which stage a version is in.
:::

## Understanding Git Flow

Git Flow is a branching model introduced by Vincent Driessen in 2010 that has become widely adopted in software development. It defines a strict branching structure designed around project releases, using multiple parallel long-lived branches.

### Conventional Git Flow Structure

In traditional Git Flow:
- **main/master**: Production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch for features
- **feature/\***: Individual feature development
- **release/\***: Release preparation branches

Changes flow through a defined path:
1. Features are developed in feature branches
2. Features merge into develop
3. Release branches are created from develop
4. After testing, releases merge into main and back to develop

### Git Flow for Infrastructure

When applied to infrastructure-as-code, Git Flow needs adaptation because:
- Infrastructure has **persistent state** that doesn't reset between branches
- You can't easily **test infrastructure in isolation** like application code
- **Merge conflicts** in infrastructure often have wider implications
- **Rollback** means reverting infrastructure, not just code

This pattern adapts Git Flow by using branches as deployment channels that environments subscribe to, rather than following the strict feature → develop → release → main flow.

<KeyPoints>
- How Git branches can serve as release channels for infrastructure
- Why merge-based promotion provides clear audit trails
- The trade-offs of long-lived branches for infrastructure code
- Strategies for managing branch divergence and merge conflicts
</KeyPoints>

## Use Cases

Use the **Git Flow: Branches as Channels** pattern when:

- Your team is **already familiar with Git Flow** workflows
- You want **centralized promotion control** through pull requests
- You need **clear audit trails** of what was promoted when
- Your organization requires **approval gates** for promotions
- You prefer **merge-based deployment** workflows
- You have strong **CI/CD integration** with Git events
- You want to **decouple promotion velocity** between environments

## Problem

Traditional Git Flow works well for application development but needs adaptation for infrastructure:

- **State Management**: Infrastructure has persistent state that doesn't reset between branches
- **Testing Challenges**: Can't easily test infrastructure changes in isolation
- **Merge Conflicts**: Infrastructure code often has more structural conflicts
- **Drift Potential**: Long-lived branches can diverge significantly
- **Rollback Complexity**: Reverting merges affects all environments on that branch

Despite these challenges, many teams prefer Git Flow because it provides familiar workflows and strong tooling support.

## Solution

Adapt Git Flow for infrastructure by using branches as release channels that environments subscribe to. Each branch represents a promotion stage, and changes flow through branches via merges.

### Branch Structure

```text
main (or master)
  │
  ├── channels/prod        # Production channel
  │     │
  │     ├── channels/staging   # Staging channel
  │           │
  │           └── channels/dev     # Development channel
  │                 │
  │                 └── feature/*  # Feature branches
```

:::info Singleton Infrastructure
Not all infrastructure concepts map to SDLC environments. Many things are singletons - for example, in AWS, there can only be one organization, one organizational CloudTrail, one Control Tower setup, etc.

For singleton infrastructure that doesn't have environment-specific deployments, a single release channel such as `main` or `channels/main` makes sense as the default, rather than trying to force these into development/staging/production paradigms.
:::

### Channel Branch Strategy

1. **Long-lived Channel Branches**: Create persistent branches for each environment tier
2. **Feature Branches**: Short-lived branches for individual changes
3. **Promotion via Merges**: Advance versions by merging between channel branches
4. **Environment Subscription**: Environments reference channel branches, not tags

## Implementation

### Basic Git Flow Setup

<File title="Branch Structure">
```text
Repository Structure:
├── channels/
│   ├── dev         # Development channel (latest changes)
│   ├── staging     # Staging channel (pre-production)
│   └── prod        # Production channel (stable)
├── feature/        # Feature development
└── main           # Integration branch (not used for deployments)
```
</File>

### Component Vendoring from Branches

With Git Flow, components are vendored from specific branches using `vendor.yaml`. **Each channel must be vendored to a distinct path** so that different environments can reference different versions of the component:

<File title="vendor.yaml">
```yaml
spec:
  sources:
    # Vendor VPC from dev channel to dev-specific path
    - component: vpc-dev
      source: "git::https://github.com/acme/infrastructure.git//components/terraform/vpc?ref=channels/dev"
      targets:
        - "components/terraform/channels/dev/vpc"

    # Vendor VPC from staging channel to staging-specific path
    - component: vpc-staging
      source: "git::https://github.com/acme/infrastructure.git//components/terraform/vpc?ref=channels/staging"
      targets:
        - "components/terraform/channels/staging/vpc"

    # Vendor VPC from production channel to prod-specific path
    - component: vpc-prod
      source: "git::https://github.com/acme/infrastructure.git//components/terraform/vpc?ref=channels/prod"
      targets:
        - "components/terraform/channels/prod/vpc"
```
</File>

:::warning Critical: Distinct Vendoring Paths Required
Each channel **must** be vendored to a unique path. If all channels vendor to the same path (e.g., `components/terraform/vpc`), the last vendored channel will overwrite the others, and all environments will end up using the same code regardless of stack configuration.
:::

### Stack Configuration

After vendoring components from the appropriate branches to distinct paths, stacks use `metadata.component` to reference the correct channel-specific path:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="dev" label="Development" default>
<File title="stacks/dev/us-east-1.yaml">
```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    vpc:
      metadata:
        # Point to the dev channel vendored path
        component: channels/dev/vpc
      settings:
        workspace_key_prefix: "dev/vpc"
      vars:
        name: "dev-use1-vpc"
        cidr_block: "10.0.0.0/16"
```
</File>
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="staging" label="Staging">
<File title="stacks/staging/us-east-1.yaml">
```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    vpc:
      metadata:
        # Point to the staging channel vendored path
        component: channels/staging/vpc
      settings:
        workspace_key_prefix: "staging/vpc"
      vars:
        name: "staging-use1-vpc"
        cidr_block: "10.1.0.0/16"
```
</File>
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="prod" label="Production">
<File title="stacks/prod/us-east-1.yaml">
```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    vpc:
      metadata:
        # Point to the production channel vendored path
        component: channels/prod/vpc
      settings:
        workspace_key_prefix: "prod/vpc"
      vars:
        name: "prod-use1-vpc"
        cidr_block: "10.2.0.0/16"
```
</File>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Rollback Strategy

Rolling back in Git Flow involves reverting merges or resetting branches:

### Option 1: Revert the Merge Commit

```bash
# Find the merge commit to revert
git log --oneline --merges channels/prod

# Create a revert branch
git checkout -b revert-deployment channels/prod
git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>

# Push and create PR
git push origin revert-deployment
```

### Option 2: Reset Branch (Requires Force Push)

```bash
# Reset to previous known good state
git checkout channels/prod
git reset --hard <previous-good-commit>

# Force push (requires permissions)
git push --force-with-lease origin channels/prod
```

### Option 3: Fast-Forward to Previous State

```bash
# If the previous state is tagged
git checkout channels/prod
git merge --ff-only <previous-version-tag>
git push origin channels/prod
```

:::warning
Rolling back a branch affects all environments subscribed to that branch. Consider the impact carefully.
:::

## Benefits

The **Git Flow: Branches as Channels** pattern provides:

- **Familiar Workflow**: Leverages well-understood Git Flow concepts
- **Centralized Control**: Promotions happen through reviewed pull requests
- **Clear Audit Trail**: Git history shows what was promoted when
- **Flexible Velocity**: Different channels can move at different speeds
- **Strong Tooling**: Excellent CI/CD and GitHub/GitLab integration
- **Approval Gates**: Native support for review requirements

## Drawbacks

The pattern has significant trade-offs to consider:

- **Branch Divergence**: Long-lived branches naturally drift apart
- **Merge Conflicts**: Infrastructure code often has structural conflicts
- **Complex Rollbacks**: Rolling back after multiple changes have merged is complicated - cherry-picking individual commits is non-trivial and error-prone
- **Testing Limitations**: Can't fully test infrastructure in isolated branches
- **State Confusion**: Branch switches don't affect Terraform state
- **Delayed Visibility**: Pinning stages to release tracks means you can't observe the future impact of changes on other environments until opening PRs to those environments
- **Larger Releases**: The pattern often leads to batched, larger releases rather than smaller incremental updates
- **Promotion Overhead**: Every change requires multiple merges through the branch hierarchy

## Best Practices

- **Use Configuration for Environment-Specific Behavior:** Use Terraform variables and environment-specific configuration to control behavior per channel. While runtime feature flags can help in application code, they're less natural in infrastructure-as-code and add operational complexity.

  <File title="components/terraform/vpc/variables.tf">
  ```hcl
  variable "enable_experimental_features" {
    description = "Enable experimental VPC features"
    type        = bool
    default     = false
  }

  variable "channel" {
    description = "Deployment channel (dev/staging/prod)"
    type        = string
  }

  locals {
    # Enable features based on channel
    enable_flow_logs = var.channel != "dev" ? true : var.enable_experimental_features
    enable_ipv6      = var.channel == "dev" ? true : false
  }
  ```
  </File>

- **Document Channel Policies:** Maintain clear channel policies documenting channel definitions, promotion rules, and approval requirements to ensure consistent promotion practices across the team.

  <File title="docs/channel-policy.md">
  ```markdown
  # Channel Branch Policy

  ## Channel Definitions
  - **channels/dev**: Latest development, updated continuously
  - **channels/staging**: Pre-production validation, updated daily
  - **channels/prod**: Production stable, updated weekly

  ## Promotion Rules
  1. All changes must enter through channels/dev
  2. Automated tests must pass before promotion
  3. Staging requires soak time before prod promotion
  4. Production promotions require approvals
  ```
  </File>

## Security and Access Control

### GitHub Environments

Use GitHub Environments to manage deployments with proper access controls:

<File title=".github/environments configuration">
```yaml
# GitHub Repository Settings → Environments
environments:
  development:
    branches:
      - channels/dev
    reviewers: []
    deployment_protection_rules:
      - required_reviewers: 0

  staging:
    branches:
      - channels/staging
    reviewers:
      - "@org/platform-team"
    deployment_protection_rules:
      - required_reviewers: 1
      - wait_timer: 30  # minutes

  production:
    branches:
      - channels/prod
    reviewers:
      - "@org/platform-leads"
      - "@org/security-team"
    deployment_protection_rules:
      - required_reviewers: 2
      - wait_timer: 60  # minutes
```
</File>

### OIDC Permissions by Branch

Configure cloud provider permissions based on the branch being deployed:

<File title=".github/workflows/deploy.yml">
```yaml
name: Deploy Infrastructure
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - channels/dev
      - channels/staging
      - channels/prod

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read

    steps:
      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
        with:
          role-to-assume: |
            ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/channels/prod' && secrets.PROD_DEPLOY_ROLE ||
                github.ref == 'refs/heads/channels/staging' && secrets.STAGING_DEPLOY_ROLE ||
                secrets.DEV_DEPLOY_ROLE }}
          aws-region: us-east-1
```
</File>

### Repository Rulesets

Use GitHub repository rulesets to enforce branch protection and merge requirements:

<File title="Repository ruleset configuration">
```yaml
# GitHub Repository Settings → Rulesets
rulesets:
  - name: "Production Channel Protection"
    target: branch
    enforcement: active
    conditions:
      ref_name:
        include:
          - "~DEFAULT_BRANCH"
          - "channels/prod"
    rules:
      - pull_request:
          required_approving_review_count: 2
          dismiss_stale_reviews_on_push: true
          require_code_owner_review: true
      - required_status_checks:
          contexts:
            - "terraform-plan"
            - "security-scan"
            - "policy-check"
      - non_fast_forward: true  # Prevent force pushes

  - name: "Staging Channel Protection"
    target: branch
    enforcement: active
    conditions:
      ref_name:
        include:
          - "channels/staging"
    rules:
      - pull_request:
          required_approving_review_count: 1
      - required_status_checks:
          contexts:
            - "terraform-plan"
            - "security-scan"
```
</File>

These security controls ensure:
- **Branch-based permissions**: OIDC roles are scoped to specific branches
- **Environment protection**: Deployment approvals and wait timers for production
- **Merge protection**: Required reviews and status checks before channel updates
- **Audit trail**: All deployments and approvals are logged in GitHub

## Summary

Git Flow: Branches as Channels adapts the familiar Git Flow model for infrastructure management. It provides strong control through pull requests, clear audit trails, and excellent tooling integration. While it requires discipline to manage branch divergence and handle merge conflicts, teams already comfortable with Git Flow often find this pattern intuitive and powerful. The key to success is maintaining synchronization between channels and having clear policies for promotion and rollback.

:::tip Key Takeaway
Git Flow for infrastructure works best when you have strong CI/CD practices and can manage branch divergence effectively. It's ideal for teams that want centralized control with familiar Git workflows.
