<PillBox>Atmos Design Pattern</PillBox>
<Intro>
The **Configuration Catalog** is your library of configuration defaults. It provides strategies for organizing and managing reusable component configurations across multiple stacks, enabling you to maintain DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) configuration while providing flexibility for customization across different environments, regions, and organizational units.
</Intro>

The Configuration Catalog is one of Atmos's most powerful features, allowing you to create a library of pre-configured components that can be easily imported and customized for different deployment contexts. Whether you're managing a simple multi-environment setup or a complex multi-organization architecture, these patterns help you maintain consistency while avoiding configuration duplication.

This pattern can also serve as a **service catalog** when you define predefined service configurations that teams can consume.

<KeyPoints>
- Creating a centralized library of reusable component configurations
- Using catalogs to maintain consistency across environments while allowing customization
- Combining catalogs with mixins for powerful configuration inheritance
- Leveraging templates for dynamic component generation
- Understanding when to use catalogs vs inline configuration
</KeyPoints>

## Available Patterns

The Configuration Catalog patterns provide different approaches for organizing and managing component configurations:

### Core Pattern: Basic Configuration Catalog
The foundation pattern that establishes a centralized library of component configurations. This pattern creates a mirror structure of your Terraform components in the `stacks/catalog` directory, making it easy to find and manage default configurations.

### Advanced Patterns

#### 1. [Mixins](/design-patterns/component-catalog/mixins)
Reusable configuration fragments that encapsulate settings you want to apply consistently. Define region defaults, stage defaults, or tenant defaults once in a mixin and import where needed.

#### 2. [Component Archetypes](/design-patterns/component-catalog/with-mixins)
Pre-configured component variants for specific use cases. Instead of configuring each instance from scratch, define archetypes like `s3-bucket/public`, `s3-bucket/logging`, or `s3-bucket/artifacts` that encapsulate best practices for that use case.

#### 3. [Configuration Catalog Template](/design-patterns/component-catalog/template)
Uses Go templates within catalog configurations to dynamically generate component settings. This pattern enables sophisticated configuration logic and reduces repetition when dealing with patterns in your infrastructure.

## Use-cases

Use the **Configuration Catalog** pattern when:

- You have many components that are provisioned in multiple stacks (many OUs, accounts, regions) with different configurations for each stack

- You need to make the components' default configurations reusable across different stacks

- You want the component catalog folders structures to mirror the Terraform components folder structure to make it easy to find and manage

- You want to keep the configurations [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)


## Benefits

The **Configuration Catalog** pattern provides the following benefits:

- The defaults for the components are defined in just one place (in the catalog) making the entire
  configuration [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)

- The defaults for the components are reusable across many environments by using hierarchical [imports](/stacks/imports)

- It's easy to add a new manifest in the component's catalog to enable a new component's feature, then import the manifest into the corresponding
  stacks where the feature is required

## Design Pattern

The **Configuration Catalog** pattern prescribes the following:

- For each Terraform component, create a folder with the same name in `stacks/catalog` to make it symmetrical and easy to find.
  For example, the `stacks/catalog/vpc` folder should mirror the `components/terraform/vpc` folder.

- In the component's catalog folder, create `defaults.yaml` manifest with all the default values for the component (the defaults that can be reused
  across multiple environments). Define all the required Atmos sections, e.g. `metadata`, `settings`, `vars`, `env`.

- In the component's catalog folder, add other manifests for different combinations of component configurations.
  We refer to them as archetype manifests. Each archetype can import the `defaults.yaml` file to reuse the default values and make the entire config
  DRY. For example:

  - `stacks/catalog/vpc/disabled.yaml` - component manifest with the component disabled (`vars.enabled: false`)
  - `stacks/catalog/vpc/dev.yaml` - component manifest with the settings related to the `dev` account
  - `stacks/catalog/vpc/staging.yaml` - component manifest with the settings related to the `staging` account
  - `stacks/catalog/vpc/prod.yaml` - component manifest with the settings related to the `prod` account
  - `stacks/catalog/vpc/ue2.yaml` - component manifest with the settings for `us-east-2` region
  - `stacks/catalog/vpc/uw2.yaml` - component manifest with the settings for `us-west-2` region
  - `stacks/catalog/vpc/feature-1.yaml` - component manifest with `feature-1` setting enabled

:::note
Having the `dev`, `staging`, `prod`, `ue2` and `uw2` manifests in the component's catalog makes the most sense for multi-org, multi-OU and/or
multi-region architectures, such that there will be multiple dev/staging/prod or region configurations, which get imported into multiple Org/OU
top-level stack manifests.
:::

- After we have defined the manifests for different use-cases, we import them into different top-level stacks depending on a particular use-case.
  For example:

  - import the `catalog/vpc/ue2.yaml` manifest into the `stacks/mixins/region/us-east-2.yaml` mixin since we need the `vpc`
    component with the `us-east-2` region-related config provisioned in the region
  - import the `catalog/vpc/uw2.yaml` manifest into the `stacks/mixins/region/us-west-2.yaml` mixin since we need the `vpc`
    component with the `us-west-2` region-related config provisioned in the region
  - import the `catalog/vpc/dev.yaml` manifest into the `stacks/orgs/acme/plat/dev/us-east-2.yaml` top-level stack since we need the `vpc`
    component with the dev-related config provisioned in the stack
  - import the `catalog/vpc/prod.yaml` manifest into the `stacks/orgs/acme/plat/prod/us-east-2.yaml` top-level stack since we need the `vpc`
    component with the prod-related config provisioned in the stack
  - import the `catalog/vpc/staging.yaml` manifest into the `stacks/orgs/acme/plat/staging/us-east-2.yaml` top-level stack since we need the `vpc`
    component with the dev-related config provisioned in the stack
  - import the `catalog/vpc/disabled.yaml` manifest into a stack where we want the `vpc` component to be disabled (e.g. temporarily until it's needed)
  - etc.


## Example

The following example shows the Atmos stack and component configurations to provision the `vpc` and `vpc-flow-logs-bucket` components into
a multi-account, multi-region environment. The components' configurations for each account and region are defined in the components' catalog.

## Limitations

The **Configuration Catalog** pattern has the following limitations and drawbacks:

- Although it's always recommended to use, the catalog structure described by the pattern can be complex for basic infrastructures,
  e.g. for a very simple organizational structure (one organization and OU), and just a few components deployed into a few accounts and regions

:::note

To address the limitations of the **Configuration Catalog** Design Pattern when you are provisioning a very basic infrastructure, use the
[Inline Configuration](/design-patterns/inline-component-configuration) pattern.
