# Component Catalog


## Use-cases

Use the **Component Catalog** pattern when:

- You have many components that are provisioned in multiple stacks (many OUs, accounts, regions) with different configurations for each stack

- You need to make the components' default configurations reusable across different stacks

- You want the component catalog folders structures to mirror the Terraform components folder structure to make it easy to find and manage

- You want to keep the configurations [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)


## Benefits

The **Component Catalog** pattern provides the following benefits:

- The defaults for the components are defined in just one place (in the catalog) making the entire
  configuration [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)

- The defaults for the components are reusable across many environments by using hierarchical [imports](/core-concepts/stacks/imports)

- It's easy to add a new manifest in the component's catalog to enable a new component's feature, then import the manifest into the corresponding
  stacks where the feature is required

## Design Pattern

The **Component Catalog** pattern prescribes the following:

- For each Terraform component, create a folder with the same name in `stacks/catalog` to make it symmetrical and easy to find.
  For example, the `stacks/catalog/vpc` folder should mirror the `components/terraform/vpc` folder.

- In the component's catalog folder, create `defaults.yaml` manifest with all the default values for the component (the defaults that can be reused
  across multiple environments). Define all the required Atmos sections, e.g. `metadata`, `settings`, `vars`, `env`.

- In the component's catalog folder, add other manifests for different combinations of component configurations.
  We refer to them as archetype manifests. Each archetype can import the `defaults.yaml` file to reuse the default values and make the entire config
  DRY. For example:

  - `stacks/catalog/vpc/disabled.yaml` - component manifest with the component disabled (`vars.enabled: false`)
  - `stacks/catalog/vpc/dev.yaml` - component manifest with the settings related to the `dev` account
  - `stacks/catalog/vpc/staging.yaml` - component manifest with the settings related to the `staging` account
  - `stacks/catalog/vpc/prod.yaml` - component manifest with the settings related to the `prod` account
  - `stacks/catalog/vpc/ue2.yaml` - component manifest with the settings for `us-east-2` region
  - `stacks/catalog/vpc/uw2.yaml` - component manifest with the settings for `us-west-2` region
  - `stacks/catalog/vpc/feature-1.yaml` - component manifest with `feature-1` setting enabled

:::note
Having the `dev`, `staging`, `prod`, `ue2` and `uw2` manifests in the component's catalog makes the most sense for multi-org, multi-OU and/or
multi-region architectures, such that there will be multiple dev/staging/prod or region configurations, which get imported into multiple Org/OU
top-level stack manifests.
:::

- After we have defined the manifests for different use-cases, we import them into different top-level stacks depending on a particular use-case.
  For example:

  - import the `catalog/vpc/ue2.yaml` manifest into the `stacks/mixins/region/us-east-2.yaml` mixin since we need the `vpc`
    component with the `us-east-2` region-related config provisioned in the region
  - import the `catalog/vpc/uw2.yaml` manifest into the `stacks/mixins/region/us-west-2.yaml` mixin since we need the `vpc`
    component with the `us-west-2` region-related config provisioned in the region
  - import the `catalog/vpc/dev.yaml` manifest into the `stacks/orgs/acme/plat/dev/us-east-2.yaml` top-level stack since we need the `vpc`
    component with the dev-related config provisioned in the stack
  - import the `catalog/vpc/prod.yaml` manifest into the `stacks/orgs/acme/plat/prod/us-east-2.yaml` top-level stack since we need the `vpc`
    component with the prod-related config provisioned in the stack
  - import the `catalog/vpc/staging.yaml` manifest into the `stacks/orgs/acme/plat/staging/us-east-2.yaml` top-level stack since we need the `vpc`
    component with the dev-related config provisioned in the stack
  - import the `catalog/vpc/disabled.yaml` manifest into a stack where we want the `vpc` component to be disabled (e.g. temporarily until it's needed)
  - etc.


## Example

The following example shows the Atmos stack and component configurations to provision the `vpc` and `vpc-flow-logs-bucket` components into
a multi-account, multi-region environment. The components' configurations for each account and region are defined in the components' catalog.

## Limitations

The **Component Catalog** pattern has the following limitations and drawbacks:

- Although it's always recommended to use, the catalog structure described by the pattern can be complex for basic infrastructures,
  e.g. for a very simple organizational structure (one organization and OU), and just a few components deployed into a few accounts and regions

:::note

To address the limitations of the **Component Catalog** Design Pattern when you are provisioning a very basic infrastructure, use the following
patterns:

- [Inline Component Configuration](/design-patterns/inline-component-configuration)
- [Inline Component Customization](/design-patterns/inline-component-customization)
