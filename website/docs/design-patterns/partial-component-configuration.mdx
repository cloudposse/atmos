# Partial Component Configuration

The **Partial Component Configuration** Design Pattern describes the mechanism of splitting an Atmos component's configuration across many Atmos
manifests to manage, modify and apply them separately and independently in one top-level stack without affecting the others.

The mechanism is similar to [Partial Classes in C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/partial-classes-and-methods).

This is not the same as Atmos [Component Inheritance](/core-concepts/components/inheritance) where more than one Atmos components
take part in the inheritance chain. The **Partial Component Configuration** pattern deals with just one Atmos component with its configuration split
across a few configuration files.

:::note

Variations of the **Partial Component Configuration** Design Pattern were also implemented and described in the following patterns:

- [Component Catalog](/design-patterns/component-catalog)
- [Component Catalog with Mixins](/design-patterns/component-catalog-with-mixins)

:::

## Use-cases

Use the **Partial Component Configuration** pattern when:

- You have a component with a complex configuration. Some parts of the configuration must be managed and modified independently of the other parts
  of the component's configuration

- Different parts of the component's configuration can be applied to different stacks independently of the other stacks

- You want to keep the parts of the configuration reusable and [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)

## Benefits

The **Partial Component Configuration** pattern provides the following benefits:

- Allows managing components with complex configurations where some parts of the configurations must be managed and modified independently of the
  other parts

- Different parts of component' configurations can be applied to different stacks independently of the other stacks

- Allows keeping the parts of the configurations reusable across many stacks and [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)

## Example

Suppose that we have EKS clusters provisioned in many accounts and regions. The clusters can run different Kubernetes versions.
Each cluster will need to be upgraded to the next Kubernetes version independently without affecting the configurations for the other clusters in
the other accounts and regions.

The following example shows how to configure partial manifests for the `eks/cluster` Atmos component. The defaults for all clusters are defined in the
`stacks/catalog/eks/cluster/defaults.yaml` manifest, while the settings related to different Kubernetes versions are defined in the manifests in the
`stacks/catalog/eks/cluster/mixins` folder. Then, the defaults and one of the mixins are imported into a top-level stack to provide the final
configuration for the `eks/cluster` component in the stack.

```console
   │   # Centralized stacks configuration (stack manifests)
   ├── stacks
   │   └── catalog  # component-specific defaults
   │       └── eks
   │           └── cluster
   │               ├── defaults.yaml
   │               └── mixins
   │                   ├── k8s-1-27.yaml
   │                   ├── k8s-1-28.yaml
   │                   └── k8s-1-29.yaml
   │   # Centralized components configuration
   └── components
       └── terraform  # Terraform components (a.k.a Terraform "root" modules)
           └── eks
               └── cluster
```

Add the following minimal configuration to `atmos.yaml` [CLI config file](/cli/configuration) :

```yaml title="atmos.yaml"
components:
  terraform:
    base_path: "components/terraform"

stacks:
  base_path: "stacks"
  name_pattern: "{tenant}-{environment}-{stage}"
  included_paths:
    # Tell Atmos to search for the top-level stack manifests in the `orgs` folder and its sub-folders
    - "orgs/**/*"
  excluded_paths:
    # Tell Atmos that the `defaults` folder and all sub-folders don't contain top-level stack manifests
    - "defaults/**/*"

schemas:
  jsonschema:
    base_path: "stacks/schemas/jsonschema"
  opa:
    base_path: "stacks/schemas/opa"
  atmos:
    manifest: "stacks/schemas/atmos/atmos-manifest/1.0/atmos-manifest.json"
```

Add the following configuration to the `stacks/catalog/eks/clusters/defaults.yaml` manifest:

```yaml title="stacks/catalog/eks/clusters/defaults.yaml"
components:
  terraform:
    eks/cluster:
      metadata:
        # Point to the Terraform component in `components/terraform/eks/cluster`
        component: eks/cluster
      vars:
        name: eks
        availability_zones: [ ] # Use the VPC subnet AZs
        managed_node_groups_enabled: true
        node_groups:
          # will create 1 node group for each item in map
          main:
            # EKS AMI version to use, e.g. "1.16.13-20200821" (no "v").
            ami_release_version: null
            # Type of Amazon Machine Image (AMI) associated with the EKS Node Group
            ami_type: AL2_x86_64
            # Whether to enable Node Group to scale its AutoScaling Group
            cluster_autoscaler_enabled: false
            # Configure storage for the root block device for instances in the Auto Scaling Group
            block_device_map:
              "/dev/xvda":
                ebs:
                  encrypted: true
                  volume_size: 200 # GB
                  volume_type: "gp3"
            # Set of instance types associated with the EKS Node Group
            instance_types:
              - c6a.large
            # Desired number of worker nodes when initially provisioned
            desired_group_size: 2
            max_group_size: 3
            min_group_size: 2
```

Add the following configuration to the `stacks/catalog/eks/clusters/mixins/k8s-1-27.yaml` manifest:

```yaml title="stacks/catalog/eks/clusters/mixins/k8s-1-27.yaml"
components:
  terraform:
    eks/cluster:
      vars:
        cluster_kubernetes_version: "1.27"

Import the `stacks/catalog/eks/clusters/default.yaml` and `stacks/catalog/eks/clusters/mixins/k8s-1-27.yaml` manifests into a top-level stack,
for example `stacks/orgs/acme/plat/prod/us-east-2.yaml`:

```yaml title="stacks/orgs/acme/plat/prod/us-east-2.yaml"
import:
  - orgs/acme/plat/prod/_defaults
  - mixins/region/us-east-2

  # EKS cluster configuration
  - catalog/eks/clusters/defaults
  # Import the mixin for the required Kubernetes version to define the k8s version and addon versions for the EKS cluster in this stack.
  # This is an example of partial component configuration in Atmos where the config for the component is split across many Atmos stack manifests (stack config files).
  # It's similar to Partial Classes in C# (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/partial-classes-and-methods).
  # This is not the same as 'Atmos Component Inheritance' (https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/components/inheritance)
  # where more than one Atmos component participates in the inheritance chain.
  - catalog/eks/clusters/mixins/k8s-1-27
```

Provision the component in the stack by executing the following command:

```shell
atmos terraform apply eks/cluster -s plat-ue2-prod
```

When the `eks/cluster` component is provisioned, Atmos imports the partial component configurations from the `catalog/eks/clusters/defaults.yaml` and
`catalog/eks/clusters/mixins/k8s-1-27.yaml` manifests, deep-merges the partial configs in the order they are defined in the imports, and generates the
final variables and settings for the component in the stack.

When you need to upgrade an EKS cluster in one account and region to the next Kubernetes version, just update the imported manifest in one top-level
stack and provision the EKS cluster without affecting the clusters in the other stacks. For example, to upgrade the cluster to the next Kubernetes
version `1.28`, update the imported mixin from `catalog/eks/clusters/mixins/k8s-1-27` to `catalog/eks/clusters/mixins/k8s-1-28`. All other EKS
clusters in the other accounts and regions will stay at the current Kubernetes version `1.27` until they are ready to be upgraded.
