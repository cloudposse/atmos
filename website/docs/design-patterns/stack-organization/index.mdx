<PillBox>Atmos Design Patterns</PillBox>

<Intro>
These patterns show how to organize your stack files as your infrastructure grows from simple to complex.
</Intro>

## Start Here

**New to Atmos?** Start with the simplest pattern that meets your needs:

| Pattern | Best For |
|---------|----------|
| [Basic Stack Organization](/design-patterns/stack-organization/basic-stack-organization) | Single region, dev/staging/prod environments |
| [Multi-Region Configuration](/design-patterns/stack-organization/multi-region-configuration) | Deploying to multiple AWS regions |
| [Organizational Hierarchy](/design-patterns/stack-organization/organizational-hierarchy-configuration) | Enterprise with multiple teams, accounts, regions |

## Building Blocks

These patterns can be combined with the patterns above:

| Pattern | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| [Mixins](/design-patterns/component-catalog/mixins) | Reusable configuration fragments (region defaults, stage defaults) |
| [Layered Stack Configuration](/design-patterns/stack-organization/layered-stack-configuration) | Group components by function (network, data, compute) |
| [_defaults.yaml Convention](/design-patterns/stack-organization/defaults-pattern) | Naming convention for inheritance files |

## Progression Path

Most teams follow this progression as they grow:

```
Basic (dev/staging/prod)
    ↓
Multi-Region (add regions)
    ↓
Organizational Hierarchy (add teams/accounts)
```

Each pattern builds on the previous one. You don't need to start with the most complex pattern—start simple and evolve.

:::tip
Even if you know you'll need enterprise scale eventually, start with the Basic pattern to learn Atmos concepts, then migrate to more complex patterns as needed.
