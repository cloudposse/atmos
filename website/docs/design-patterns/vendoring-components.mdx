<PillBox>Atmos Design Pattern</PillBox>
<Intro>
The **Vendoring Components** Design Pattern is a trunk-based approach that involves copying external component code into your main branch while maintaining metadata about its origin and lineage. This approach provides local control over third-party dependencies, predictable update cycles, and the ability to apply custom modifications when necessary.
</Intro>

Vendoring gives teams full control over their infrastructure dependencies by bringing external code in-house. As a trunk-based pattern, all vendored code lives in the main branch alongside your other infrastructure code, with version updates happening through commits to that branch. Unlike direct references to external repositories, vendored components can be audited, modified, and updated on your schedule. This pattern is particularly valuable when dealing with critical third-party modules, compliance requirements, or when you need to maintain patches against upstream code.

<KeyPoints>
- How vendoring provides control over external dependencies and update timing
- Why maintaining origin metadata is crucial for lineage tracking
- Strategies for bulk updates and intentional divergence
- The trade-offs between local control and maintenance burden
</KeyPoints>

## Use Cases

Use the **Vendoring Components** pattern when:

- You need **predictable update windows** for third-party components
- **Compliance requirements** mandate code auditing and approval
- You need to **apply custom patches** to upstream components
- **Network restrictions** limit access to external repositories
- You want **resilience against upstream availability** issues
- You need **consistent versioning** across all environments without external dependencies
- **Upstream cadence** doesn't match your release schedule

## Problem

Direct dependencies on external repositories create several challenges:

- **Upstream Breaking Changes**: Unexpected changes can break deployments
- **Availability Risks**: External sources may become unavailable
- **Audit Challenges**: Difficult to review all code changes in external dependencies
- **Timing Mismatches**: Upstream release schedules may not align with your needs
- **Patching Limitations**: Cannot modify external code without forking
- **Network Dependencies**: Requires internet access during deployment

Vendoring addresses these issues by bringing code under local control while maintaining traceability.

## Solution

Copy external component code into your repository with clear metadata about its origin, version, and any local modifications. Use Atmos's vendor command to manage the process systematically.

### Core Principles

1. **Local Copies**: All external code is copied into your repository
2. **Origin Tracking**: Maintain metadata about where code came from
3. **Bulk Updates**: Update multiple components together in controlled windows
4. **Intentional Divergence**: Clearly mark and track local modifications
5. **Audit Trail**: Document all vendor updates and changes

## Implementation with Atmos

Atmos provides built-in vendoring support through the `vendor.yaml` manifest and `atmos vendor` command.

### Basic Vendor Configuration

<File title="vendor.yaml">
```yaml

```
</File>

## Vendoring Workflow

### 1. Initial Vendoring

```bash
# Pull all configured components
atmos vendor pull

# Pull specific component
atmos vendor pull --component vpc

# Pull with specific version override
atmos vendor pull --component vpc --version 2.2.0

# Dry run to see what would be vendored
atmos vendor pull --dry-run
```

### 2. Tracking Local Modifications

When making local changes to vendored components:

<File title="components/terraform/vpc/LOCAL_MODIFICATIONS.md">
```markdown
# Local Modifications

This component has been vendored from github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc

## Modifications

### 2024-01-21: Compliance Tags
- **File**: main.tf
- **Author**: john.doe@example.com
- **Reason**: Added required compliance tags per security policy
- **Changes**:
  ```hcl
  # Added to locals
  compliance_tags = {
    DataClassification = var.data_classification
    ComplianceLevel    = var.compliance_level
    LastReviewed       = timestamp()
  }
  ```

### 2024-01-25: Custom Security Groups
- **File**: security-groups.tf (new file)
- **Author**: jane.smith@example.com
- **Reason**: Added organization-specific security group rules
- **Note**: This file is not present in upstream

## Update Instructions

When updating from upstream:
1. Save local modifications: `git stash`
2. Vendor update: `atmos vendor pull --component vpc`
3. Reapply modifications: `git stash pop`
4. Resolve any conflicts
5. Test thoroughly
6. Update this document
```
</File>

### 3. Bulk Updates

Perform controlled bulk updates using Atmos vendor commands:

```bash
# Update all vendored components
atmos vendor pull

# Update specific component
atmos vendor pull --component vpc

# Update with specific version
atmos vendor pull --component vpc --version v2.2.0

# Dry run to preview changes
atmos vendor pull --dry-run
```

Track vendor updates in your vendor manifest:

```yaml
# vendor-manifest.yaml
components:
  vpc:
    origin:
      repository: "github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc"
      ref: "2.2.0"  # Updated from 2.1.0
      vendor_date: "2024-01-25"
    upstream_version: "2.2.0"
    changelog: |
      - Updated from 2.1.0 to 2.2.0
      - Added support for IPv6
      - Fixed NAT gateway issue
```

### 4. Handling Divergence

When intentionally diverging from upstream:

<File title="vendor.yaml">
```yaml
spec:
  sources:
    - component: vpc
      source: "github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc.git"
      version: "2.1.0"
      targets:
        - "vpc"
      # Mark as diverged to prevent auto-updates
      diverged: true
      divergence_reason: |
        Custom modifications for multi-region support.
        See LOCAL_MODIFICATIONS.md for details.
        Manual review required for any updates.
```

### Vendor Configuration

<File title="vendor.yaml">
```yaml
apiVersion: atmos/v1
kind: AtmosVendorConfig
metadata:
  name: production-components
  description: Vendored components for production infrastructure

spec:
  settings:
    base_path: "components/terraform"
    parallel: true
    max_parallel: 3

  sources:
    # VPC with specific version and patches
    - component: vpc
      source: "github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc.git///?ref={{.Version}}"
      version: "2.1.0"
      targets:
        - "vpc"
      included_paths:
        - "*.tf"
        - "*.tfvars"
        - "README.md"
        - "LICENSE"
      excluded_paths:
        - "examples/**"
        - "test/**"
      # Post-vendor patches
      patches:
        - "patches/vpc-compliance-tags.patch"

    # EKS with latest stable
    - component: eks
      source: "github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-eks-cluster.git///?ref={{.Version}}"
      version: "4.0.0"
      targets:
        - "eks"
      mixins:
        - "mixins/eks-defaults.yaml"

    # RDS from internal repository

        - path: "s3/v4"
          version: "4.0.0"
```
</File>

### Stack Configuration

<File title="stacks/prod/us-east-1.yaml">
```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    vpc:
      metadata:
        component: vpc
      settings:
        workspace_key_prefix: "prod/vpc"
      source:
        # Local path to vendored component
        uri: "./components/terraform/vpc"
      vars:
        name: "prod-use1-vpc"
        cidr_block: "10.0.0.0/16"
        # Custom variables for local modifications
        data_classification: "sensitive"
        compliance_level: "high"
```
</File>

### Vendor Auditing

Check the status of vendored components using the vendor manifest:

```bash
# Check vendor manifest for outdated components
atmos vendor status

# Validate vendored components
atmos validate components

# Run security scans on vendored code
atmos validate stacks --include-vendored
```

Track vendor status in the manifest:

```yaml
# vendor-manifest.yaml
components:
  vpc:
    status: "up-to-date"
    last_checked: "2024-01-25"
    upstream_version: "2.2.0"
    local_version: "2.2.0"
    security_scan:
      date: "2024-01-25"
      issues: 0
      scanner: "atmos"
```

## Benefits

The **Vendoring Components** pattern provides:

- **Local Control**: Full control over code and update timing
- **Predictable Updates**: Updates happen on your schedule
- **Audit Capability**: Review all code before deployment
- **Offline Operation**: No runtime dependency on external repositories
- **Custom Patches**: Apply and maintain local modifications
- **Compliance**: Meet security and audit requirements
- **Resilience**: Protected from upstream availability issues

## Drawbacks

The pattern also has limitations:

- **Maintenance Burden**: You own security patches and bug fixes
- **Repository Size**: Vendored code increases repository size
- **Update Lag**: May fall behind upstream improvements
- **Merge Complexity**: Reconciling local changes with updates
- **Tooling Requirements**: Need processes for vendor management

## Best Practices

### 1. Maintain Clear Lineage

Always track where code came from:

```yaml
# In every vendored component directory
.vendor-info:
  origin: "github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc"
  version: "2.1.0"
  vendored: "2024-01-20"
  modified: true
  modifications:
    - "Added compliance tags"
    - "Custom security groups"
```

### 2. Regular Update Cycles

Schedule regular vendor updates:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/vendor-update.yml
name: Vendor Update Check
on:
  schedule:
    # Every Monday at 9 AM
    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  check-updates:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Atmos
        uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos@v2
      - name: Check for Vendor Updates
        run: |
          # Check vendor status
          atmos vendor status

      - name: Create Issue if Updates Available
        run: |
          # Create issue if updates are available
          if atmos vendor status --check-updates; then
            atmos vendor status --format=markdown > vendor-report.md
            gh issue create \
              --title "Vendor Updates Available: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)" \
              --body-file vendor-report.md \
              --label "vendor-update"
          fi
```

### 3. Document Divergence

Clearly document why and how you've diverged:

```markdown
# Divergence Documentation

## Component: VPC
**Diverged**: Yes
**Date**: 2024-01-21
**Reason**: Compliance requirements

### Changes Made:
1. Added mandatory compliance tags
2. Modified security group rules
3. Added custom outputs for monitoring

### Update Strategy:
- Manual review required
- Cannot auto-update due to custom changes
- Patches must be manually applied

### Future Plans:
- Working with upstream to incorporate changes
- Target convergence: Q2 2024
```

### 4. Test Vendored Components

Maintain tests for vendored components:

```bash
# Test vendored components
for component in components/terraform/*; do
  echo "Testing $component..."
  cd $component
  terraform init
  terraform validate
  tflint
  tfsec .
  cd -
done
```

### 5. Security Scanning

Regularly scan vendored code:

```bash
# Security scanning workflow
- name: Security Scan
  run: |
    # Scan for vulnerabilities
    trivy fs components/terraform/

    # Check for secrets
    gitleaks detect --source=components/terraform/

    # Terraform security
    tfsec components/terraform/
```

## Migration Strategies

### To Vendoring from Direct References

1. **Inventory External Dependencies**: List all external module references
2. **Create Vendor Configuration**: Define sources in vendor.yaml
3. **Initial Vendoring**: Run `atmos vendor pull`
4. **Update Stack References**: Change from external URLs to local paths
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure vendored version produces same results
6. **Document Origin**: Create vendor-manifest.yaml

### From Vendoring to Other Patterns

If moving away from vendoring:

1. **To Direct References**: Update source URIs to point to external repositories
2. **To Release Tracks**: Organize vendored components into track folders
3. **To Folder Versioning**: Rename vendored folders with version suffixes

## Summary

Vendoring Components provides maximum control over external dependencies at the cost of increased maintenance responsibility. It's ideal for organizations with strict compliance requirements, those needing predictable update windows, or teams that must maintain custom patches. While it increases repository size and maintenance burden, the benefits of local control, audit capability, and resilience often justify these trade-offs for critical infrastructure components.

:::tip Key Takeaway
Vendoring is about taking ownership of your dependencies. Use it when external code is critical to your infrastructure and you need full control over when and how it changes.
