<Intro>
Atmos natively supports opinionated workflows for [HashiCorp Packer](https://www.packer.io/). Packer automates the creation of machine images for multiple platforms, enabling you to build immutable infrastructure with consistent, versioned images.
</Intro>

For a complete list of supported commands, please see the Atmos [packer](/cli/commands/packer/usage) documentation.

## Why Use Packer with Atmos?

Packer components in Atmos allow you to:

- **Build immutable infrastructure** — Create golden AMIs and machine images that are versioned and reproducible
- **Patch images for compliance** — Apply security patches and compliance requirements consistently across your image library
- **Manage images like any other component** — Use the same inheritance, imports, and configuration patterns you use for Terraform

## Example: Build a Packer Component

To build a Packer component using the `atmos` CLI, run the following commands:

```shell
atmos packer init myimage --stack=ue2-dev
atmos packer build myimage --stack=ue2-dev
```

where:

- `myimage` is the Packer component to build (from the `components/packer` folder)
- `--stack=ue2-dev` is the stack context for the build

Short versions of the command-line arguments can be used:

```shell
atmos packer init myimage -s ue2-dev
atmos packer build myimage -s ue2-dev
```

## Example: Validate a Packer Template

To validate a Packer template before building:

```shell
atmos packer validate myimage -s ue2-dev
```

## Example: Inspect a Packer Template

To inspect a Packer template and see its configuration:

```shell
atmos packer inspect myimage -s ue2-dev
```
