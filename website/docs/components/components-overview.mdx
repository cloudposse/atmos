<Intro>
Components are the building blocks of your infrastructure. They are opinionated, reusable units of infrastructure-as-code that solve specific problems—Terraform root modules, Helmfiles, or Packer templates.
</Intro>

## What are Components?

In Atmos, a **component** consists of two parts:

1. **Implementation** — The infrastructure code itself (a Terraform root module, Helmfile, or Packer template)
2. **Configuration** — The settings that customize how the component is deployed in each environment

This separation of concerns is fundamental to Atmos. You write the implementation once, then configure it differently for each environment through [stacks](/stacks).

## Component Configuration

Components are configured in the `components` section of stack files. Here's what component configuration looks like:

<File title="stacks/deploy/prod/us-east-1.yaml">
```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    vpc:
      metadata:
        component: vpc           # Points to components/terraform/vpc/
      vars:
        cidr_block: "10.0.0.0/16"
        availability_zones:
          - us-east-1a
          - us-east-1b
      settings:
        spacelift:
          workspace_enabled: true

    eks-cluster:
      metadata:
        component: eks/cluster   # Points to components/terraform/eks/cluster/
      vars:
        cluster_name: prod-eks
        kubernetes_version: "1.28"
```
</File>

Each component configuration includes:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `metadata` | Component location, inheritance, and Atmos behavior |
| `vars` | Input variables passed to the component |
| `settings` | Atmos and integration settings (not passed to the component) |

## Component Instances

A **component instance** is a specific deployment of a component in a stack. The same component implementation can have many instances across your infrastructure:

```yaml
# Same "vpc" component, different instances
components:
  terraform:
    # Instance: "vpc" in prod/us-east-1
    vpc:
      vars:
        cidr_block: "10.0.0.0/16"

    # Instance: "vpc-secondary" in prod/us-east-1 (using same component)
    vpc-secondary:
      metadata:
        component: vpc           # Same implementation
      vars:
        cidr_block: "10.1.0.0/16"
```

Each instance:
- Has its own Terraform state (or Helmfile release, Packer build)
- Can have different variable values
- Is independently deployable

## Implementation vs Configuration

| Aspect | Implementation | Configuration |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **Location** | `components/terraform/vpc/` | `stacks/prod/us-east-1.yaml` |
| **Contains** | Terraform code, resources, modules | Variables, settings, metadata |
| **Changes** | When infrastructure logic changes | When environment needs differ |
| **Reuse** | Single implementation | Many configurations |

This separation allows you to:
- Write a component once and deploy it across many environments
- Customize behavior through configuration, not code duplication
- Maintain consistency while supporting environment-specific requirements
- Update all instances by changing the implementation

## Component Types

Atmos natively supports three component types:

| Type | Implementation | Description |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| **[Terraform/OpenTofu](/components/terraform)** | Terraform root modules | Provision cloud infrastructure |
| **[Helmfile](/components/helmfile)** | Helmfile configurations | Deploy Helm charts to Kubernetes |
| **[Packer](/components/packer)** | Packer templates | Build machine images |

Each type has its own configuration schema, but they share common patterns for `metadata` and `settings`.

## Directory Structure

Components are stored in your project's `components/` directory:

```
components/
├── terraform/           # Terraform root modules
│   ├── vpc/
│   ├── eks/
│   │   └── cluster/
│   └── rds/
├── helmfile/            # Helmfile configurations
│   ├── nginx-ingress/
│   └── cert-manager/
└── packer/              # Packer templates
    └── ubuntu-base/
```

## Next Steps

- [Describe Components](/describe/component) — Inspect fully-merged component configurations
- [Component Library](/components/library) — Use pre-built components
- [Terraform Components](/components/terraform) — Terraform root modules
- [Helmfile Components](/components/helmfile) — Helmfile configurations
- [Packer Components](/components/packer) — Packer templates
