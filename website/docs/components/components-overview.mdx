description: Introduction to Atmos components - the building blocks of your infrastructure

<Intro>
Components are the building blocks of your infrastructure. They are opinionated, reusable modules that solve specific infrastructure problems.
</Intro>

## What are Components?

In Atmos, a **component** is a self-contained unit of infrastructure code that implements a specific piece of your architecture. Components are designed to be:

- **Reusable** across multiple environments and stacks
- **Composable** so they can work together to build complex architectures
- **Opinionated** with sensible defaults while remaining configurable

## Component Types

Atmos natively supports three component types:

| Type | Description | Location |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **[Terraform/OpenTofu](/components/terraform)** | Infrastructure as Code using Terraform root modules | `components/terraform/` |
| **[Helmfile](/components/helmfile)** | Kubernetes deployments using Helm charts | `components/helmfile/` |
| **[Packer](/components/packer)** | Machine image building | `components/packer/` |

## How Components Work

Components are stored in your project's `components/` directory and are referenced by [stacks](/stacks). When you run Atmos commands like `atmos terraform apply`, Atmos:

1. Reads the stack configuration to determine which component to use
2. Merges variables from the stack hierarchy
3. Executes the component with the resolved configuration

```
components/
├── terraform/           # Terraform components
│   ├── vpc/
│   ├── eks-cluster/
│   └── rds/
├── helmfile/            # Helmfile components
│   ├── nginx-ingress/
│   └── cert-manager/
└── packer/              # Packer components
    └── ubuntu-base/
```

## Components vs Stack Configuration

| Concept | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Component** | The infrastructure code (what to build) | `components/terraform/vpc/` |
| **Stack Configuration** | How to configure the component for an environment | `stacks/prod/us-east-1.yaml` |

This separation allows you to:
- Write a component once and use it across many environments
- Customize behavior through configuration, not code duplication
- Maintain consistency while supporting environment-specific requirements
