<Intro>
Atmos supports configuring [Terraform/OpenTofu Backends](/components/terraform/backends)
to define where [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state) and [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/docs/language/state/) store its state,
and [Remote State](/stacks/remote-state) to get the outputs of a [Terraform/OpenTofu component](/components),
provisioned in the same or a different [Atmos stack](/learn/stacks), and use the outputs as inputs to another Atmos component.
</Intro>

Bear in mind that Atmos is simply managing the configuration of the Backend;
provisioning the backend resources themselves is the responsibility of a Terraform/OpenTofu component.

Atmos also supports Remote State Backends (in the `remote_state_backend` section), which can be used to configure the
following:

- Override [Terraform Backend](/components/terraform/backends) configuration to access the
  remote state of a component (e.g. override the IAM role to assume, which in this case can be a read-only role)

- Configure a remote state of type `static` which can be used to provide configurations for
  [Brownfield development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownfield_(software_development))

## Override Terraform Backend Configuration to Access Remote State

Atmos supports the `remote_state_backend` section which can be used to provide configuration to access the remote state
of components.

To access the remote state of components, you can override
any [Terraform Backend](/components/terraform/backends)
configuration in the `backend` section using the `remote_state_backend` section. The `remote_state_backend` section
is a first-class section, and it can be defined globally at any scope (organization, tenant, account, region), or per
component, and then deep-merged using [Atmos Component Inheritance](/howto/inheritance).

For example, let's suppose we have the following S3 backend configuration for the entire organization
(refer to [AWS S3 Backend](/components/terraform/backends#aws-s3-backend) for more details):

```yaml title="stacks/orgs/acme/_defaults.yaml"
terraform:
  backend_type: s3
  backend:
    s3:
      acl: "bucket-owner-full-control"
      encrypt: true
      bucket: "your-s3-bucket-name"
      dynamodb_table: "your-dynamodb-table-name"
      key: "terraform.tfstate"
      region: "your-aws-region"
      role_arn: "arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxx:role/terraform-backend-read-write"
```

Let's say we also have a read-only IAM role, and we want to use it to access the remote state instead of the read-write
role, because accessing remote state is a read-only operation, and we don't want to give the role more permissions than
it requires - this is the [principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege).

We can add the `remote_state_backend` and `remote_state_backend_type` to override the required attributes from the
`backend` section:

```yaml title="stacks/orgs/acme/_defaults.yaml"
terraform:
  backend_type: s3  # s3, remote, vault, azurerm, gcs, cloud
  backend:
    s3:
      acl: "bucket-owner-full-control"
      encrypt: true
      bucket: "your-s3-bucket-name"
      dynamodb_table: "your-dynamodb-table-name"
      key: "terraform.tfstate"
      region: "your-aws-region"
      role_arn: "arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxx:role/terraform-backend-read-write"

  remote_state_backend_type: s3 # s3, remote, vault, azurerm, gcs, cloud, static
  remote_state_backend:
    s3:
      role_arn: "arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxx:role/terraform-backend-read-only"
      # Override the other attributes from the `backend.s3` section as needed
```

In the example above, we've overridden the `role_arn` attribute for the `s3` backend to use the read-only role when
accessing the remote state of all components. All other attributes will be taken from the `backend` section (Atmos
deep-merges the `remote_state_backend` section with the `backend` section).

When working with Terraform backends and writing/updating the state, the `terraform-backend-read-write` role will be
used. But when reading the remote state of components, the `terraform-backend-read-only` role will be used.
