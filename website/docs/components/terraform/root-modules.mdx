<Intro>
Understand how Atmos manages Terraform root modules as components, and why additional tooling is needed at scale.
</Intro>

## What is Terraform?

Terraform is a command-line utility or interpreter (like Perl or Ruby), that processes infrastructure configurations
written in ["HashiCorp's Configuration Language" ("HCL")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HCL) to orchestrate infrastructure provisioning.
Its chief role is to delineate and structure infrastructure definitions. Terraform by itself is not a framework.

:::note Disambiguation
The term "Terraform" is used in this documentation to refer to generic concepts such as providers, modules, stacks, the
HCL-based domain-specific language and its interpreter. Atmos works with [OpenTofu](/cli/configuration/components/terraform#using-opentofu).

<details>
<summary>Fun Fact!</summary>

HCL is backward compatible with JSON, although it's not a strict superset of JSON.
HCL is more human-friendly and readable, while JSON is often used for machine-generated configurations.
This means you can write Terraform configurations in HCL or JSON, and Terraform will understand them.
This feature is particularly useful for programmatically generating configurations or integration with systems that already use JSON.
</details>

## How has Terraform HCL Evolved?

Terraform's HCL started strictly as a configuration language, not a markup or programming language, although it has evolved
considerably over the years.

As Terraform progressed and HCL evolved, notably from version _0.12_ onwards, HCL began incorporating features typical
of programming languages (albeit without a debugger!). This shift enriched infrastructure definitions, positioning HCL
more as a [domain-specific programming language (DSL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) for
defining infrastructure than strictly a configuration language (aka data interchange formats like JSON). As a result,
the complexity of configuring Terraform projects has risen, while Terraform's inherent capabilities to be configured
haven't evolved at the same pace.

- **Rich Expressions:** Introduced a richer expression syntax, removing the need for interpolations.

- **For Loops and Conditionals:** Added for expressions and conditional expressions.

- **Type System:** Introduced a more explicit type system for input and output values.

## Why is additional tooling needed when using Terraform?

**Every foundational tool begins simply.**

As users grow more advanced and their ambitions expand, the need for advanced tooling emerges. These shifts demonstrate that core
technologies naturally progress, spawning more advanced constructs to tackle increased intricacies and enhance efficiency -- all
while retaining their core essence. Just as CSS, NodeJS, Docker, Helm, and many other tools have evolved to
include higher-order utilities, Terraform, too, benefits from additional orchestration tools, given the complexities and challenges
users face at different stages of adoption.

Examples of tools like these are numerous, like:

- **CSS has Sass:** Sass provides more expressive styling capabilities, variables, and functions, making stylesheets more maintainable and organized, especially for large projects.
- **NodeJS has React:** React brings component-based architecture to JavaScript, enhancing the creation of interactive UIs, improving code reusability, and better supporting the development of large-scale applications.
- **Docker has Docker Compose:** Docker Compose simplifies the management and orchestration of multi-container Docker applications, making it easier to define, run, and scale services collectively.
- **Helm charts have Helmfiles:** While Helm charts define the blueprints of Kubernetes services, Helmfiles enable better orchestration, management, and deployment of multiple charts, similar to coordinating various instruments in a symphony.
- **Kubernetes manifests have Kustomize:** Kustomize allows customization of Kubernetes manifests without changing their original form, facilitating dynamic configurations tailored to specific deployment scenarios.

**These days, no one would dream of building a modern web app without a framework. Why should Terraform be any different?**

When considering Terraform in the context of large-scale organizations or enterprises, it's clear that Terraform and its inherent language don't address all challenges. This is why teams progress through [10 stages of maturity](/intro/why-atmos). With hundreds, or even thousands, of components spread across hundreds of accounts, cloud providers, and managed by a vast number of DevOps engineers and developers, the complexity becomes overwhelming and difficult to manage.

A lot of the same challenges faced by NodeJS, Docker, Helm and Kubernetes also exist in Terraform as well.

**Challenges in Terraform are centered around Root Modules:**
- **Large-Scale Architectures**: Providing better support for large-scale service-oriented architectures
- **Composition**: Making it straightforward to compose architectures of multiple "root modules"
- **Code Reusability and Maintainability**: Simplifying the definition and reuse of "root modules"
- **Ordered Dependencies**: Handling orchestration, management, and deployment of multiple loosely coupled "root modules"
- **Sharing State**: Sharing state between "root modules"
- **CI/CD Automation**: Enhancing CI/CD automation, especially in monorepos, when there are no rollback capabilities

These are not language problems. These are framework problems. Without a coherent framework, Terraform is hard to use at scale.
Ultimately, the goal is to make Terraform more scalable, maintainable, and developer-friendly, especially in complex and large-scale environments.

## Terraform Concepts

<dl>
<dt>Child Modules</dt>
<dd>Child modules are reusable pieces of Terraform code that accept parameters (variables) for customization and emit outputs.
    Outputs can be passed between child modules and used to connect them together.
    They are stateless and can be invoked multiple times. Child modules can also call other child modules, making
    them a primary method for reducing repetition in Terraform HCL code; it's how you DRY up your HCL code.</dd>

<dt>Root Modules</dt>
<dd>Root modules in Terraform are the topmost modules that can call child modules or directly use Terraform code.
    The key distinction between root and child modules is that root modules maintain Terraform state,
    typically stored in a remote state backend like S3. Root modules cannot call other root modules,
    but they can access the outputs of any other root module using Remote State.</dd>

<dt>State Backends</dt>
<dd>State Backends are where the desired state of your infrastructure code is stored.
    It's always defined exactly once per "root module". This where the computed state of your HCL code is stored,
    and it is what `terraform apply` will execute. The most common state backend is object storage
    like S3, but there are many other types of state backends available.</dd>

<dt>Remote State</dt>
<dd>Remote state refers to the concept of retrieving the outputs from other root modules.
    Terraform natively supports passing information between "root modules" without any additional tooling,
    a capability we rely on in Atmos.</dd>

:::info Disambiguation

- **Terraform Component** is a [Terraform Root Module](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules#the-root-module) and stored typically in `components/terraform/$name` that consists of the resources defined in the `.tf` files in a working directory
  (e.g. [components/terraform/infra/vpc](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/tree/main/examples/quick-start-advanced/components/terraform/vpc))

- **Stack** provides configuration (variables and other settings) for a Terraform Component and is defined in one or more Atmos stack manifests
  (a.k.a. stack config files)

## Using Submodules (Child Modules)

If your components rely on local submodules, our convention is to use a `modules/` subfolder of the component to store them.
