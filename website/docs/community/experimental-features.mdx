# Experimental Features

<Intro>
Experimental features in Atmos are new capabilities that are still being refined based on community feedback. They may change or be removed in future releases.
</Intro>

## What "Experimental" Means

Features marked as experimental:

- **May not be fully functional** - Some documented functionality may not yet be implemented
- **Are under active development** - Features are being refined and validated through community feedback
- **May have breaking changes** - APIs or behavior might change without following semantic versioning guarantees
- **Are not recommended for critical production workflows** - Use at your own risk until they graduate to stable

When the experimental annotation is removed, all documented functionality will be fully implemented and the feature will be considered stable.

## How to Provide Feedback

We actively seek feedback on experimental features:

1. **GitHub Discussions** - Share your experiences and suggestions in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/cloudposse/discussions)
2. **GitHub Issues** - Report bugs or request improvements via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/issues)
3. **Slack Community** - Join our [Slack](https://slack.cloudposse.com) for real-time discussions

## Graduation Criteria

Experimental features graduate to stable when:

- All documented functionality is fully implemented
- The API has been validated through real-world usage
- Community feedback has been incorporated
- Breaking changes are no longer expected

## Current Experimental Features
