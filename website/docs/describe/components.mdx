<Intro>
Describing components helps understand the final, fully deep-merged configuration for an [Atmos component](/components/components) in each [stack](/learn/stacks).
</Intro>

The more [DRY a configuration is due to imports](/stacks/imports), the more [derived the configuration is due to inheritance](/stacks/inheritance), the harder it may be to understand what the final component configuration will be.

For example, if we wanted to understand what the final configuration looks like for a "vpc" component running in the "production" stack in the `us-east-2` AWS region, we could do that by calling the [`atmos describe component`](/cli/commands/describe/component) command and view the YAML output:

```shell
atmos describe component vpc -s ue2-prod
```

For more powerful filtering options, consider [describing stacks](/describe/stacks) instead.

The other helpful use-case for describing components and stacks is when developing policies for [validation](/validation/validating) of
[Atmos components](/components/components) and [Atmos stacks](/learn/stacks). OPA policies can enforce what is or is not permitted. Everything in the output can be validated using policies that you develop.
