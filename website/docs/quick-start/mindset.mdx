Atmos can change how you think about the Terraform code you write to build your infrastructure. 

When you design cloud architectures with Atmos, you will first break it apart into pieces called components. 

Then, you will implement Terraform "root modules" for each of those components. 

To ensure your components are highly reusable, parameterize them with variables. 
Design them to serve a single purpose, making them the smallest possible unit of infrastructure in a typical 
software development lifecycle (SDLC). Group pieces that usually change together and separate those that change independently.

Finally, you connect your components together using stacks, so that everything comes together. 

In this tutorial, we’ll guide you through the thought process of building Terraform "root modules" that are suitable for use as components.

You're about discover a new way to think about terraform... 


<h1> Your Architecture is Made up of Components</h1>

Start by thinking about your architecture in terms its logical components.

For example, let’s take a typical architecture of a modern website. Its components include a network, a cluster, some applications running on it,
a database to store data, a cache, and maybe some object storage. Each of these logical pieces is a component and typically changes independently.
They are loosely related and this relationship forms a stack. A stack logically combines components without tightly coupling them,
ensuring each component’s state is separate. This approach minimizes the blast radius of changes, keeps the state separate, and 
allows teams to own components. Plus, it encourages reuse since there is a finite number ways to express infrastructure.

Then, to implement this architecture with Atmos, you will usually follow these same five steps everytime.
