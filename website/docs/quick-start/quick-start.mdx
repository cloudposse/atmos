# Quick Start

Take 30 minutes to learn the most important Atmos concepts.

## Thinking in Atmos

Atmos can change how you think about the designs and the infrastructure you build.
When you build infrastructure with Atmos, you will first break it apart into pieces called components.
Then, you will describe the different configurations for each of your components.
Finally, you will connect your components together so that the data flows through them.
In this Quick Start, weâ€™ll guide you through the thought process of building an infrastructure with Atmos.
