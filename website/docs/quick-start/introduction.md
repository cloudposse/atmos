# Introduction

Atmos is a CLI and a powerful enterprise-grade workflow automation tool for DevOps. It's also a framework that prescribes patterns and best practices
to structure and organize components and stacks to design for organizational complexity and provision multi-account environments for complex
organizations. It allows you very quickly configure and provision infrastructure into many environments (e.g. AWS accounts and regions), and make
those configurations extremely DRY.

In this Quick Start guide, we describe how to provision infrastructure managed by Terraform into different AWS environments.
The configurations for the environments are managed by Atmos.

The steps to configure and provision the infrastructure are as follows:

- [Install Atmos](/quick-start/install-atmos)
- [Configure Repository](/quick-start/configure-repository)
- [Configure CLI](/quick-start/configure-cli)
- [Create Components](/quick-start/create-components)
- [Create Atmos Stacks](/quick-start/create-atmos-stacks)
- [Provision](/quick-start/provision)
