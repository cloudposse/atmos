Atmos is a CLI and a powerful enterprise-grade workflow automation tool for DevOps. It's also a framework that prescribes patterns and best practices
to organize components and stacks to design for organizational complexity. It allows you very quickly configure and provision infrastructure into
many environments (AWS Organizational Units, accounts, regions), and make those configurations extremely DRY.

In this Quick Start guide, we describe how to provision infrastructure managed by Terraform into different AWS environments.
The configurations for the environments are managed by Atmos.

The steps to configure and provision the infrastructure are as follows:

- [Install Atmos](/quick-start/install-atmos)
- [Configure Repository](/quick-start/configure-repository)
- [Configure CLI](/quick-start/configure-cli)
- [Create Components](/quick-start/create-components)
- [Create Atmos Stacks](/quick-start/create-atmos-stacks)
- [Provision](/quick-start/provision)
