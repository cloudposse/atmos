# Introduction

Atmos is a CLI and a powerful enterprise-grade workflow automation tool for DevOps.

It's also a framework that prescribes patterns and best practices to structure and organize components and stacks to design for organizational
complexity and provision multi-account environments for complex organizations.

It allows you to very quickly configure and provision infrastructure into many environments (e.g. AWS accounts and regions), and make those
configurations extremely DRY.

In this Quick Start guide, we describe how to provision infrastructure managed by Terraform into different AWS environments.
The configurations for the environments are managed by Atmos.

This Quick Start guide describes the steps to configure and provision the infrastructure
from this [Quick Start](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/tree/master/examples/quick-start) repository.

You can clone it and configure to your own needs. The repository should be a good start to get yourself familiar with Atmos.
