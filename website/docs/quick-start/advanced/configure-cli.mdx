In the previous step, we've decided on the following:

- Use a monorepo to configure and provision two Terraform components into three AWS accounts and two AWS regions
- The filesystem layout for the infrastructure monorepo
- To be able to use [Component Remote State](/stacks/remote-state), we put the `atmos.yaml` CLI config file
  into `/usr/local/etc/atmos/atmos.yaml` folder and set the ENV var `ATMOS_BASE_PATH` to point to the absolute path of the root of the repo

Next step is to configure `atmos.yaml`.

`atmos.yaml` configuration file is used to control the behavior of the `atmos` CLI. The file supports many features that are configured in different
sections of the `atmos.yaml` file. For the description of all the sections, refer to [CLI Configuration](/cli/configuration).

For the purpose of this Quick Start, below is the minimum configuration required for Atmos to work with Terraform and to
configure [Atmos components](/components) and [Atmos stacks](/learn/stacks). Copy the YAML config below into your `atmos.yaml`
file.

<File title="atmos.yaml">
```yaml
# CLI config is loaded from the following locations (from lowest to highest priority):
# system dir ('/usr/local/etc/atmos' on Linux, '%LOCALAPPDATA%/atmos' on Windows)
# home dir (~/.atmos)
# current directory
# ENV vars
# Command-line arguments
#
# It supports POSIX-style Globs for file names/paths (double-star '**' is supported)
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)

# Base path for components, stacks and workflows configurations.
# Can also be set using 'ATMOS_BASE_PATH' ENV var, or '--base-path' command-line argument.
# Supports both absolute and relative paths.
# If not provided or is an empty string, 'components.terraform.base_path', 'components.helmfile.base_path', 'stacks.base_path'
# and 'workflows.base_path' are independent settings (supporting both absolute and relative paths).
# If 'base_path' is provided, 'components.terraform.base_path', 'components.helmfile.base_path', 'stacks.base_path'
# and 'workflows.base_path' are considered paths relative to 'base_path'.

The `atmos.yaml` configuration file defines the following sections.

__NOTE:__ below is the description of the sections relevant to this Quick Start guide. For the description of all the sections, refer
to [CLI Configuration](/cli/configuration).

<dl>
  <dt>`base_path`</dt>
  <dd>The base path for components, stacks and workflows configurations. We set it to `./` so it will use the current working directory. Alternatively, we can override this behavior by setting the ENV var `ATMOS_BASE_PATH` to point to another directory location.</dd>

  <dt>`components.terraform.base_path`</dt>
  <dd>The base path to the Terraform components (Terraform root modules). As described in [Configure Repository](/quick-start/advanced/configure-repository), we've decided to put the Terraform components into the `components/terraform` directory, and this setting tells Atmos where to find them. Atmos will join the base path (set in the `ATMOS_BASE_PATH` ENN var) with `components.terraform.base_path` to calculate the final path to the Terraform components.</dd>

  <dt>`components.terraform.apply_auto_approve`</dt>
  <dd>If set to `true`, Atmos automatically adds the `-auto-approve` option to instruct Terraform to apply the plan without asking for confirmation when executing `terraform apply` command.</dd>

  <dt>`components.terraform.deploy_run_init`</dt>
  <dd>If set to `true`, Atmos runs `terraform init` before executing [`atmos terraform deploy`](/cli/commands/terraform/deploy) command.</dd>

  <dt>`components.terraform.init_run_reconfigure`</dt>
  <dd>If set to `true`, Atmos automatically adds the `-reconfigure` option to update the backend configuration when executing `terraform init` command.</dd>

  <dt>`components.terraform.auto_generate_backend_file`</dt>
  <dd>If set to `true`, Atmos automatically generates the Terraform backend file from the component configuration when executing `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` commands.</dd>

  <dt>`stacks.base_path`</dt>
  <dd>The base path to the Atmos stacks. As described in [Configure Repository](/quick-start/advanced/configure-repository), we've decided to put the stack configurations into the `stacks` directory, and this setting tells Atmos where to find them. Atmos will join the base path (set in the `ATMOS_BASE_PATH` ENN var) with `stacks.base_path` to calculate the final path to the stacks.</dd>

  <dt>`stacks.included_paths`</dt>
  <dd>List of file paths to the top-level stacks in the `stacks` directory to include in search when Atmos searches for the stack where the component is defined when executing `atmos` commands.</dd>

  <dt>`stacks.excluded_paths`</dt>
  <dd>List of file paths to the top-level stacks in the `stacks` directory to exclude from search when Atmos searches for the stack where the component is defined when executing `atmos` commands.</dd>

  <dt>`stacks.name_pattern`</dt>
  <dd>Atmos stack name pattern. When executing `atmos` commands, Atmos does not use the configuration file names and their filesystem locations to search for the stack where the component is defined. Instead, Atmos uses the context variables (`namespace`, `tenant`, `environment`, `stage`) to search for the stack. The stack config file names can be anything, and they can be in any folder in any sub-folder in the `stacks` directory. For example, when executing the `atmos terraform apply vpc -s tenant1-ue2-dev` command, the stack `tenant1-ue2-dev` is specified by the `-s` flag. By looking at `name_pattern: "{tenant}-{environment}-{stage}"` and processing the tokens, Atmos knows that the first part of the stack name is `tenant`, the second part is `environment`, and the third part is `stage`. Then Atmos searches for the stack configuration file (in the `stacks` directory) where `tenant: tenant1`, `environment: ue2` and `stage: dev` are defined (inline or via imports).</dd>

  <dt>`workflows.base_path`</dt>
  <dd>The base path to Atmos [Workflows](/workflows) files.</dd>

  <dt>`logs.verbose`</dt>
  <dd>Set to `true` to increase log verbosity. When set to `true`, Atmos prints to the console all the steps it takes to find and process the `atmos.yaml` CLI config file, and all the steps it takes to find the stack and find and process the component in the stack.</dd>

  <dt>`commands`</dt>
  <dd>Configuration for [Atmos Custom Commands](/cli/configuration/commands).</dd>

  <dt>`schemas`</dt>
  <dd>See [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) and [OPA Policy](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) configurations for: [Atmos Schema Validation](/cli/configuration/schemas), [Atmos Custom Validation](/validation/validating).</dd>
