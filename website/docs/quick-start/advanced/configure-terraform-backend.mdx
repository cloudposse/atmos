import File from '@site/src/components/File'

In the previous steps, we've configured the `vpc-flow-logs-bucket` and `vpc` Terraform components to be provisioned into three AWS accounts
(`dev`, `staging`, `prod`) in the two AWS regions (`us-east-2` and `us-west-2`).

By default, Terraform will use a backend called [local](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/local), which stores
Terraform state on the local filesystem, locks that state using system APIs, and performs operations locally. For any scenario beyond a basic
playground setup, such as staging or production environments, we'll provision and
configure the Terraform [s3](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/s3) backend.

## Terraform Local Backend

Terraform's local backend is designed for development and testing purposes and is generally not recommended for production use. There are several
reasons why using the local backend in a production environment may not be suitable:

- **State Management**: The local backend stores the Terraform state file on the local file system. In a production environment, it's crucial to have
  a robust and scalable solution for managing the Terraform state. Storing state locally can lead to issues with collaboration, concurrency, and
  consistency.

- **Concurrency and Locking**: When multiple users or automation processes are working with Terraform concurrently, it's essential to ensure that only
  one process can modify the infrastructure at a time. The local backend lacks built-in support for locking mechanisms that prevent multiple Terraform
  instances from modifying the state simultaneously. This can lead to race conditions and conflicting changes.

- **Collaboration**: In a production environment with multiple team members, it's important to have a centralized and shared state. The local backend
  does not provide a way to easily share the state across different team members or systems. A remote backend, such as Amazon S3, Azure Storage, or
  HashiCorp Consul, is more suitable for collaboration.

- **Durability and Backup**: The local backend does not provide durability or backup features. If the machine where Terraform is run experiences
  issues, there's a risk of losing the state file, leading to potential data loss. Remote backends offer better durability and often provide features
  for versioning and backup.

- **Remote Execution and Automation**: In production, it's common to use Terraform in automated workflows, such as continuous integration/continuous
  deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Remote backends are better suited for these scenarios, allowing for seamless integration with automation tools and
  supporting the deployment of infrastructure as code in a reliable and controlled manner.

To address these concerns, it's recommended to use one of the supported remote backends, such as Amazon S3, Azure Storage, Google Cloud Storage,
HashiCorp Consul, or Terraform Cloud, for production environments. Remote backends provide better scalability, collaboration support, and durability,
making them more suitable for managing infrastructure at scale in production environments.

## Terraform S3 Backend

Terraform's S3 backend is a popular remote backend for storing Terraform state files in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket. Using S3 as a
backend offers several advantages over local backends, particularly in production environments. Here's an overview of the key features and benefits of
using the Terraform S3 backend:

- **Remote State Storage**: The Terraform state file is stored remotely in an S3 bucket. This allows multiple users and Terraform instances to access
  and manage the same state file, promoting collaboration and consistency across deployments.

- **Concurrency and Locking**: S3 backend supports state file locking, which prevents multiple Terraform instances from modifying the state file
  simultaneously. This helps avoid conflicts and ensures that changes are applied in a coordinated manner, especially in multi-user or automated
  environments.

- **Durability and Versioning**: S3 provides high durability for object storage, and it automatically replicates data across multiple availability
  zones. Additionally, versioning can be enabled on the S3 bucket, allowing you to track changes to the state file over time. This enhances data
  integrity and provides a safety net in case of accidental changes or deletions.

- **Access Control and Security**: S3 supports fine-grained access control policies, allowing you to restrict access to the state file based on AWS
  Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and policies. This helps ensure that only authorized users or processes can read or modify the Terraform
  state.

- **Integration with AWS Features**: The S3 backend integrates well with other AWS services. For example, you can use AWS Key Management Service (KMS)
  for server-side encryption of the state file, and you can leverage AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles for secure access to the S3
  bucket.

- **Terraform Remote Operations**: The S3 backend can be used in conjunction with Terraform Remote Operations, allowing you to run Terraform
  commands remotely while keeping the state in S3. This is useful for scenarios where the Terraform client and the infrastructure being managed are
  separated.

To configure Terraform to use an S3 backend, you typically provide the S3 bucket name and an optional key prefix in your Terraform configuration.
Here's a simplified example:

<File title="backend.tf" type="hcl">
```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    acl          = "bucket-owner-full-control"
    bucket       = "your-s3-bucket-name"
    key          = "path/to/terraform.tfstate"
    region       = "your-aws-region"
    encrypt      = true
    use_lockfile = true  # Native S3 locking (Terraform 1.10+)
  }
}
```
</File>

:::note Native S3 Locking
Terraform 1.10+ and OpenTofu 1.8+ support native S3 locking via `use_lockfile: true`, eliminating the need for a
DynamoDB table. For older versions, see [legacy DynamoDB locking](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/s3#dynamodb-state-locking).
:::

## Provision Terraform S3 Backend

Before using Terraform S3 backend, a backend S3 bucket needs to be provisioned.

:::tip Automatic Backend Provisioning
Atmos can automatically provision S3 backends with secure defaults. See [Backend Provisioning](/core-concepts/components/terraform/backend-provisioning)
for the fastest way to get started.
:::

Alternatively, you can provision the S3 bucket using the [tfstate-backend](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-tfstate-backend) Terraform module and
[tfstate-backend](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/tree/main/modules/tfstate-backend) Terraform component (root module).

The [tfstate-backend](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components/tree/main/modules/tfstate-backend) Terraform component
can be added to the `components/terraform` folder, the configuration for the component can be added to the `stacks`, and the component itself
can be provisioned with Atmos.

Here's an example of an Atmos manifest to configure the `tfstate-backend` Terraform component:

<File title="stacks/catalog/tfstate-backend/defaults.yaml" type="stack">
```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    tfstate-backend:
      vars:
        enable_server_side_encryption: true
        enabled: true
        force_destroy: false
        name: tfstate
        prevent_unencrypted_uploads: true
```
</File>

## Configure Terraform S3 Backend

Once the S3 bucket is provisioned, you can start using it to store Terraform state for the Terraform components.
There are two ways of doing this:

- Manually create `backend.tf` file in each component's folder with the following content:
  <File title="backend.tf" type="hcl">
  ```hcl
  terraform {
    backend "s3" {
      acl                  = "bucket-owner-full-control"
      bucket               = "your-s3-bucket-name"
      encrypt              = true
      key                  = "terraform.tfstate"
      region               = "your-aws-region"
      role_arn             = "arn:aws:iam::<your account ID>:role/<IAM Role with permissions to access the Terraform backend>"
      workspace_key_prefix = "<component name, e.g. `vpc` or `vpc-flow-logs-bucket`>"
      use_lockfile         = true
    }
  }
  ```
  </File>

- Configure Terraform S3 backend with Atmos to automatically generate a backend file for each Atmos component. This is the recommended way
  of configuring Terraform state backend since it offers many advantages and will save you from manually creating a backend configuration file for
  each component

### Configure Terraform S3 Backend with Atmos

Configuring Terraform S3 backend with Atmos consists of the three steps:

- Set `auto_generate_backend_file` to `true` in the `atmos.yaml` CLI config file in the `components.terraform` section:
  <File title="atmos.yaml" type="config">
  ```yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      # Can also be set using 'ATMOS_COMPONENTS_TERRAFORM_AUTO_GENERATE_BACKEND_FILE' ENV var, or '--auto-generate-backend-file' command-line argument
      auto_generate_backend_file: true
  ```
  </File>

  Refer to [Quick Start: Configure CLI](/quick-start/advanced/configure-cli) and [CLI Configuration](/cli/configuration) for more details.

- Configure the S3 backend in one of the `_defaults.yaml` manifests. You can configure it for the entire Organization, or per OU/tenant, or per
  region, or per account.

  :::note
  The `_defaults.yaml`stack manifests contain the default settings for Organizations, Organizational Units, and accounts.
  :::

  :::info
  The `_defaults.yaml` stack manifests are not imported into other Atmos manifests automatically.
  You need to explicitly import them using [imports](/core-concepts/stacks/imports).
  :::

  To configure the S3 backend for the entire Organization, add the following config in `stacks/orgs/acme/_defaults.yaml`:

  <File title="stacks/orgs/acme/_defaults.yaml" type="stack">
  ```yaml
  terraform:
    backend_type: s3
    backend:
      s3:
        acl: "bucket-owner-full-control"
        encrypt: true
        bucket: "your-s3-bucket-name"
        key: "terraform.tfstate"
        region: "your-aws-region"
        role_arn: "arn:aws:iam::<your account ID>:role/<IAM Role with permissions to access the Terraform backend>"
        use_lockfile: true
  ```
  </File>

- (This step is optional) For each component, you can add `workspace_key_prefix` similar to the following:
  <File title="stacks/catalog/vpc.yaml" type="stack">
  ```yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      # `vpc` is the Atmos component name
      vpc:
        # Optional backend configuration for the component
        backend:
          s3:
            workspace_key_prefix: vpc
        metadata:
          # Point to the Terraform component
          component: vpc
        settings: {}
        vars: {}
        env: {}
  ```
  </File>

  Note that this is optional. If you don’t add `backend.s3.workspace_key_prefix` to the component manifest, the Atmos component name will be used
  automatically (which, in this example, is `vpc`). `/` (slash) in the Atmos component name will be replaced with `-` (dash).

  We usually don’t specify `workspace_key_prefix` for each component and let Atmos use the component name as `workspace_key_prefix`.

Once all the above is configured, when you run the commands `atmos terraform plan vpc -s <stack>`
or `atmos terraform apply vpc -s <stack>`, before executing the Terraform commands, Atmos will deep-merge the backend configurations from
the `_defaults.yaml` manifest and from the component itself, and will generate a backend config JSON file `backend.tf.json` in the component's folder,
similar to the following example:

<File title="backend.tf.json" type="json">
```json
{
  "terraform": {
    "backend": {
      "s3": {
        "acl": "bucket-owner-full-control",
        "bucket": "your-s3-bucket-name",
        "encrypt": true,
        "key": "terraform.tfstate",
        "region": "your-aws-region",
        "role_arn": "arn:aws:iam::<your account ID>:role/<IAM Role with permissions to access the Terraform backend>",
        "use_lockfile": true,
        "workspace_key_prefix": "vpc"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</File>

You can also generate the backend configuration file for a component in a stack by executing the
command [atmos terraform generate backend](/cli/commands/terraform/generate-backend). Or generate the backend configuration files for all components
by executing the command [atmos terraform generate backends](/cli/commands/terraform/generate-backends).

## Terraform Backend Inheritance

In the previous section, we configured the S3 backend for the entire Organization by adding the `terraform.backend.s3` section to
the `stacks/orgs/acme/_defaults.yaml` stack manifest. The same backend configuration (S3 bucket and IAM role) will be used for all
OUs, accounts and regions.

Suppose that for security and audit reasons, you want to use different Terraform backends for the `dev`, `staging` and `prod` accounts. Each account
needs to have a separate S3 bucket and IAM role with different permissions (for example, the `development` Team should be able to
access the Terraform backend only in the `dev` account, but not in `staging` and `prod`).

Atmos supports this use-case by using deep-merging of stack manifests, [Imports](/core-concepts/stacks/imports)
and [Inheritance](/core-concepts/stacks/inheritance), which makes the backend configuration reusable and DRY.

We'll split the backend config between the Organization and the accounts.

Add the following config to the Organization stack manifest in `stacks/orgs/acme/_defaults.yaml`:
  <File title="stacks/orgs/acme/_defaults.yaml" type="stack">
  ```yaml
  terraform:
    backend_type: s3
    backend:
      s3:
        acl: "bucket-owner-full-control"
        encrypt: true
        key: "terraform.tfstate"
        region: "your-aws-region"
        use_lockfile: true
  ```
  </File>

Add the following config to the `dev` stack manifest in `stacks/orgs/acme/plat/dev/_defaults.yaml`:

  <File title="stacks/orgs/acme/plat/dev/_defaults.yaml" type="stack">
  ```yaml
  terraform:
    backend_type: s3
    backend:
      s3:
        bucket: "your-dev-s3-bucket-name"
        role_arn: "<IAM Role with permissions to access the `dev` Terraform backend>"
  ```
  </File>

Add the following config to the `staging` stack manifest in `stacks/orgs/acme/plat/staging/_defaults.yaml`:
  <File title="stacks/orgs/acme/plat/staging/_defaults.yaml" type="stack">
  ```yaml
  terraform:
    backend_type: s3
    backend:
      s3:
        bucket: "your-staging-s3-bucket-name"
        role_arn: "<IAM Role with permissions to access the `staging` Terraform backend>"
  ```
  </File>

Add the following config to the `prod` stack manifest in `stacks/orgs/acme/plat/prod/_defaults.yaml`:

  <File title="stacks/orgs/acme/plat/prod/_defaults.yaml" type="stack">
  ```yaml
  terraform:
    backend_type: s3
    backend:
      s3:
        bucket: "your-prod-s3-bucket-name"
        role_arn: "<IAM Role with permissions to access the `prod` Terraform backend>"
  ```
  </File>

When you provision the `vpc` component into the `dev` account (by executing the command `atmos terraform apply vpc -s plat-ue2-dev`), Atmos will
deep-merge the backend configuration from the Organization-level manifest with the configuration from the `dev` manifest, and will automatically
add `workspace_key_prefix` for the component, generating the following final deep-merged backend config for the `vpc` component in the `dev` account:

<File title="backend.tf.json" type="json">
```json
{
  "terraform": {
    "backend": {
      "s3": {
        "acl": "bucket-owner-full-control",
        "bucket": "your-dev-s3-bucket-name",
        "encrypt": true,
        "key": "terraform.tfstate",
        "region": "your-aws-region",
        "role_arn": "<IAM Role with permissions to access the `dev` Terraform backend>",
        "use_lockfile": true,
        "workspace_key_prefix": "vpc"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</File>

In the same way, you can create different Terraform backends per Organizational Unit, per region, per account (or a group of accounts, e.g. `prod`
and `non-prod`), or even per component or a set of components (e.g. root-level components like `account` and IAM roles can have a separate backend),
and then configure parts of the backend config in the corresponding Atmos stack manifests. Atmos will deep-merge all the parts from the
different scopes and generate the final backend config for the components in the stacks.

## Terraform Backend with Multiple Component Instances

We mentioned before that you can configure the Terraform backend for the components manually (by creating a file `backend.tf` in each Terraform
component's folder), or you can set up Atmos to generate the backend configuration for each component in the stacks automatically. While
auto-generating the backend config file is helpful and saves you from creating the backend files for each component, it becomes a requirement
when you provision multiple instances of a Terraform component into the same environment (same account and region).

You can provision more than one instance of the same Terraform component (with the same or different settings) into the same environment by defining
many Atmos components that provide configuration for the Terraform component.

:::tip
For more information on configuring and provision multiple instances of a Terraform component,
refer to [Multiple Component Instances Atmos Design Patterns](/design-patterns/multiple-component-instances)
:::

For example, the following config shows how to define two Atmos components, `vpc/1` and `vpc/2`, which both point to
the same Terraform component `vpc`:

<File title="stack.yaml" type="stack">
```yaml
import:
  # Import the defaults for all VPC components
  - catalog/vpc/defaults

components:
  terraform:
    # Atmos component `vpc/1`
    vpc/1:
      metadata:
        # Point to the Terraform component in `components/terraform/vpc`
        component: vpc
        # Inherit the defaults for all VPC components
        inherits:
          - vpc/defaults
      # Define variables specific to this `vpc/1` component
      vars:
        name: vpc-1
        ipv4_primary_cidr_block: 10.9.0.0/18
      # Optional backend configuration for the component
      # If not specified, the Atmos component name `vpc/1` will be used (`/` will be replaced with `-`)
      backend:
        s3:
          workspace_key_prefix: vpc-1

    # Atmos component `vpc/2`
    vpc/2:
      metadata:
        # Point to the Terraform component in `components/terraform/vpc`
        component: vpc
        # Inherit the defaults for all VPC components
        inherits:
          - vpc/defaults
      # Define variables specific to this `vpc/2` component
      vars:
        name: vpc-2
        ipv4_primary_cidr_block: 10.10.0.0/18
      # Optional backend configuration for the component
      # If not specified, the Atmos component name `vpc/2` will be used (`/` will be replaced with `-`)
      backend:
        s3:
          workspace_key_prefix: vpc-2
```
</File>

If we manually create a `backend.tf` file for the `vpc` Terraform component in the `components/terraform/vpc` folder
using `workspace_key_prefix: "vpc"`, then both `vpc/1` and `vpc/2` Atmos components will use the same `workspace_key_prefix`, and they will
not function correctly.

On the other hand, if we configure Atmos to auto-generate the backend config file, then each component will have a different `workspace_key_prefix`
auto-generated by Atmos by using the Atmos component name (or you can override this behavior by specifying `workspace_key_prefix` for each component
in the component manifest in the `backend.s3.workspace_key_prefix` section).

For example, when the command `atmos terraform apply vpc/1 -s plat-ue2-dev` is executed, the following `backend.tf.json` file is generated in the
`components/terraform/vpc` folder:

<File title="backend.tf.json" type="json">
```json
{
  "terraform": {
    "backend": {
      "s3": {
        "acl": "bucket-owner-full-control",
        "bucket": "your-dev-s3-bucket-name",
        "encrypt": true,
        "key": "terraform.tfstate",
        "region": "your-aws-region",
        "role_arn": "<IAM Role with permissions to access the `dev` Terraform backend>",
        "use_lockfile": true,
        "workspace_key_prefix": "vpc-1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</File>

Similarly, when the command `atmos terraform apply vpc/2 -s plat-ue2-dev` is executed, the following `backend.tf.json` file is generated in the
`components/terraform/vpc` folder:

<File title="backend.tf.json" type="json">
```json
{
  "terraform": {
    "backend": {
      "s3": {
        "acl": "bucket-owner-full-control",
        "bucket": "your-dev-s3-bucket-name",
        "encrypt": true,
        "key": "terraform.tfstate",
        "region": "your-aws-region",
        "role_arn": "<IAM Role with permissions to access the `dev` Terraform backend>",
        "use_lockfile": true,
        "workspace_key_prefix": "vpc-2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</File>

The generated files will have different `workspace_key_prefix` attribute auto-generated by Atmos.

For this reason, configuring Atmos to auto-generate the backend configuration for the components in the stacks is recommended.
