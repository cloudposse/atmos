This Quick Start guide describes the steps to configure and provision the infrastructure
from the [Quick Start](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/tree/master/examples/quick-start) repository.

You can clone it and configure to your own needs. The repository should be a good start to get yourself familiar with configuring the validation for
Atmos components and stacks.
