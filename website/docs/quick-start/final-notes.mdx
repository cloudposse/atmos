Atmos provides unlimited flexibility in defining and configuring stacks and components in the stacks.

- Terraform components can be in different sub-folders in the `components/terraform` directory. The sub-folders can be organized by type, by teams
  that are responsible for the components, by operations that are performed on the components, or by any other category

- Atmos stack manifests can have arbitrary names and can be located in any sub-folder in the `stacks` directory. Atmos stack filesystem layout is for
  people to better organize the stacks and make the configurations DRY. Atmos (the CLI) does not care about the filesystem layout, all it cares about
  is how to find the stacks and the components in the stacks by using the context variables `namespace`, `tenant`, `environment` and `stage`

- An Atmos component can have any name that can be different from the Terraform component name. For example, two different Atmos components `vpc/1`
  and `vpc/2` can provide configuration for the same Terraform component `vpc`

- We can provision more than one instance of the same Terraform component (with the same or different settings) into the same environment by defining
  many Atmos components that provide configuration for the Terraform component. For example, the following config shows how to define two Atmos
  components, `vpc/1` and `vpc/2`, which both point to the same Terraform component `vpc`:

  ```yaml
  import:
    - orgs/acme/plat/dev/_defaults
    - mixins/region/us-east-2
    # Import the defaults for all VPC components
    - catalog/vpc/defaults

  components:
    terraform:
      # Atmos component `vpc/1`
      vpc/1:
        metadata:
          # Point to the Terraform component in `components/terraform/vpc`
          component: vpc
          # Inherit the defaults for all VPC components
          inherits:
            - vpc/defaults
        # Define/override variables specific to this `vpc/1` component
        vars:
          name: vpc-1
          ipv4_primary_cidr_block: 10.9.0.0/18

      # Atmos component `vpc/2`
      vpc/2:
        metadata:
          # Point to the Terraform component in `components/terraform/vpc`
          component: vpc
          # Inherit the defaults for all VPC components
          inherits:
            - vpc/defaults
        # Define/override variables specific to this `vpc/2` component
        vars:
          name: vpc-2
          ipv4_primary_cidr_block: 10.10.0.0/18
  ```

  Then we can execute the following `atmos` commands to provision the two VPCs into the `dev` account in the `us-east-2` region:

  ```shell
  atmos terraform apply vpc/1 -s plat-ue2-dev
  atmos terraform apply vpc/2 --stack plat-ue2-dev
  ```

All the above makes Atmos an ideal framework to organize infrastructure, to design for organizational complexity, and to provision multi-account
environments for very complex organizations.
