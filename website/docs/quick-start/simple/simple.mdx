Take 30 minutes to learn the most important Atmos concepts. 

In this simple example, we’re going to show you how you can Terraform the weather. We won’t focus on 
more advanced concepts like configuring state backends or integrating with specific cloud providers, 
allowing us to concentrate on the core concepts of Atmos.

**Spoiler alert:** you can’t actually change the weather with Terraform, but you can certainly ask for it. 
We’ll use this example to avoid relying on complicated cloud credentials, which can vary based on your 
organizational context and cloud provider. Instead, we want to focus on Terraform and how to utilize it effectively 
as a component within Atmos. Once you understand this, you’ll see how you can tailor your Terraform "root modules" 
to work seamlessly with Atmos.

:::tip

The source code for this Quick Start guide can be found in the [Atmos repo](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/tree/master/examples/demo-stacks) demo repository.
(It's the same demo you see on the Atmos landing page)

You can clone it and tweak it to your own needs. The repository should be a good start to get yourself familiar with Atmos.

:::

Then when you're ready, for a deeper understanding of Terraform state management and working with 
AWS authentication, please refer to our [advanced quick start guide](/quick-start/advanced).

## Let's get started...

Start your first project in 5 easy steps. After this, you'll be able to configure and provision infrastructure with Terraform using Atmos.

1. [Install Atmos](/install)
2. [Setup Project Repository](/quick-start/simple/configure-repository)
3. [Configure the Atmos CLI](/quick-start/simple/configure-cli)
4. [Create Atmos Stacks](/quick-start/simple/create-atmos-stacks)
5. [Deploy Everything](/quick-start/simple/provision)
