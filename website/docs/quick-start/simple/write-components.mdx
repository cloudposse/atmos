<Intro>
When you design cloud architectures with Atmos, you will first break them apart into pieces called [components](/core-concepts/components). Then, you will implement [Terraform "root modules"](/core-concepts/components/terraform) for each of those components. 
</Intro>

After we're done with this, we'll show you [how you connect your components using stacks](/quick-start/simple/create-atmos-stacks), so that everything comes together.

<KeyPoints>
- Where to put your components
- How to think about components
- How to use Terraform "root modules" as components
</KeyPoints>

<Step>
## <StepNumber/> Create a Directory for Your Components
To ensure your components are highly reusable, parameterize them with variables. 

Design them to serve a single purpose, making them the smallest possible unit of infrastructure in a typical software development lifecycle (SDLC). Group pieces that usually change together and separate those that change independently.
