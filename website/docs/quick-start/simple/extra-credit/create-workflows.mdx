<Intro>
[Atmos Workflows](/workflows) combine multiple commands into executable units of work, ideal for automating common
tasks and orchestrating “cold starts,” where you bring an environment up from scratch.
</Intro>

Workflows can call other workflows and be combined with [Custom Commands](/cli/configuration/commands). Usually, we use
workflows to provision some combinations of [Terraform](/components/terraform) components.

Defining workflows is entirely optional; use them if they are helpful for your project.

<Step>
## <StepNumber/> Configure Your Project to Support Workflows

To define workflows, update your `atmos.yaml` to tell it where to find your workflows.

Add the following `workflows` section and configure the base path to the workflows:

```yaml
workflows:
  # Can also be set using 'ATMOS_WORKFLOWS_BASE_PATH' ENV var, or '--workflows-dir' command-line arguments
  # Supports both absolute and relative paths
  base_path: "stacks/workflows"
```
</Step>


<Step>
## <StepNumber/> Create an Atmos Workflow

Now, let's create a workflow in the `stacks/workflows` directory.

```console
   │   # Centralized stacks configuration
   └── stacks/
       └── workflows/
           └── weather.yaml
```

Add the following Atmos workflows to the `stacks/workflows/weather.yaml` file:

```yaml
name: Workflows for Weather Station
description: Atmos workflows for managing Weather Station

workflows:

  plan-all:
    description: |
      Run 'terraform plan' on all 'station' components in all stacks
    steps:
      - command: terraform plan station -s dev
      - command: terraform plan station -s staging
      - command: terraform plan station -s prod

  apply-all:
    description: |
      Run 'terraform apply' on all 'station' components in all stacks
    steps:
      - command: terraform apply station -auto-approve -s dev
      - command: terraform apply station -auto-approve -s staging
      - command: terraform apply station -auto-approve -s prod
```
</Step>

<Step>

## <StepNumber/> Run the Atmos Workflow

Run the following Atmos commands to execute the workflows:

```shell
# Execute the workflow `plan-all-vpc-flow-logs` from the workflow manifest `weather.yaml`
atmos workflow plan-all -f weather

# Execute the workflow `apply-all-components` from the workflow manifest `weather.yaml`
atmos workflow apply-all -f weather
```

The `atmos workflow` CLI command supports the `--dry-run` flag. If passed, the command will just print information about
the executed workflow steps without executing them. For example:

<Terminal title="atmos workflow plan-all -f weather --dry-run">
```console
Executing the workflow 'plan-all' from 'stacks/workflows/weather.yaml'

Executing workflow step: terraform plan station -s dev
Executing workflow step: terraform plan station -s staging
Executing workflow step: terraform plan station -s prod
```
</Terminal>
</Step>
