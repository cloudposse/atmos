<Intro>
We can provision more than one instance of the same Terraform component (with the same or different settings) 
into the same environment by defining many Atmos components that provide configuration for the Terraform component.
</Intro>

For example, the following config shows how to define two Atmos components, `myapp/1` and `myapp/2`, 
which both point to the same Terraform component `myapp`:

<File>
```yaml
import:
  - orgs/acme/plat/dev/_defaults
  - mixins/region/us-east-2
  # Import the defaults for all myapp components
  - catalog/myapp/defaults

components:
  terraform:
  # Atmos component `myapp/1`
  myapp/1:
    metadata:
    # Point to the Terraform component in `components/terraform/myapp`
    component: myapp
    # Inherit the defaults for all myapp components
    inherits:
      - myapp/defaults
    # Define/override variables specific to this `myapp/1` component
    vars:
    name: myapp-1
    ipv4_primary_cidr_block: 10.9.0.0/18

  # Atmos component `myapp/2`
  myapp/2:
    metadata:
    # Point to the Terraform component in `components/terraform/myapp`
    component: myapp
    # Inherit the defaults for all myapp components
    inherits:
      - myapp/defaults
    # Define/override variables specific to this `myapp/2` component
    vars:
    name: myapp-2
    ipv4_primary_cidr_block: 10.10.0.0/18
```
</File>

<br/>

Then we can execute the following `atmos` commands to provision the two myapps into the `dev` account in the `us-east-2` region:

```shell
atmos terraform apply myapp/1 -s plat-ue2-dev
atmos terraform apply myapp/2 --stack plat-ue2-dev
```
