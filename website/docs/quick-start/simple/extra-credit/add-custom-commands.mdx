<Intro>
Atmos can be easily extended to support any number of custom CLI commands. For example, imagine you wanted to add a command
like `atmos reload-database`, you can do that with custom commands.
</Intro>

Custom commands are defined in the `commands` section in `atmos.yaml` CLI configuration file.

:::tip
Refer to [Atmos Custom Commands](/core-concepts/custom-commands) for more information about Atmos Custom Commands
:::

In this Quick Start guide, we'll define two custom commands to list the Atmos stacks in the infrastructure and the components in the stacks.

<File title="atmos.yaml">
```yaml
# Custom CLI commands
commands:
- name: ip
  description: Return my current IP
  steps:
    - curl -s https://ifconfig.me
    - echo

# Use Nested Custom Commands
- name: "github"
  commands:
  - name: "status"
    description: This command returns the number of stargazers for a GitHub repository
    steps:
      - curl -s https://www.githubstatus.com/api/v2/status.json | jq -r .status.description
```
</File>

Run the following Atmos command to list all stacks in the infrastructure:

<Terminal title="atmos list stacks">
```console
plat-gbl-dev
plat-gbl-prod
plat-gbl-staging
plat-ue2-dev
plat-ue2-prod
plat-ue2-staging
plat-uw2-dev
plat-uw2-prod
plat-uw2-staging
```
</Terminal>

Run the following Atmos command to list all components in the stack `plat-ue2-dev`:

<Terminal title="atmos list components -s plat-ue2-dev">
```console
vpc
vpc-flow-logs-bucket
```
</Terminal>
