<Intro>
Atmos can be easily extended to support any number of custom CLI commands. For example, imagine you wanted to add a command
like `atmos reload-database`, you can do that with custom commands.
</Intro>

Custom commands are defined in the `commands` section in `atmos.yaml` CLI configuration file.

<Note title="TIP">
Refer to [Atmos Custom Commands](/core-concepts/custom-commands) for more information about Atmos Custom Commands
</Note>

In this Quick Start guide, we'll define two custom commands to list the Atmos stacks in the infrastructure and the components in the stacks.

<File title="atmos.yaml">
```yaml
# Custom CLI commands
commands:
- name: ip
  description: Return my current IP
  steps:
    - curl -s https://ifconfig.me
    - echo

# Use Nested Custom Commands
- name: "github"
  commands:
  - name: "status"
    description: This command returns the number of stargazers for a GitHub repository
    steps:
      - curl -s https://www.githubstatus.com/api/v2/status.json | jq -r .status.description
```
</File>

Run the following Atmos command to get the current GitHub status.

<Terminal command="atmos github status">
```console
All Systems Operational
```
</Terminal>

Run the following Atmos command to retrieve your current public IP address.

<Terminal command="atmos ip">
```console
13.37.13.37
```
</Terminal>
