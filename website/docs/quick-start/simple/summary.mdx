Atmos provides unlimited flexibility in defining and configuring stacks and components in the stacks.

- Terraform components can be in different sub-folders in the `components/terraform` directory. The sub-folders can be organized by type, by teams
  that are responsible for the components, by operations that are performed on the components, or by any other category

- Atmos stack manifests can have arbitrary names and can be located in any sub-folder in the `stacks` directory. Atmos stack filesystem layout is for
  people to better organize the stacks and make the configurations DRY. Atmos (the CLI) does not care about the filesystem layout, all it cares about
  is how to find the stacks and the components in the stacks by using the context variables `namespace`, `tenant`, `environment` and `stage`

- An Atmos component can have any name that can be different from the Terraform component name. 
  For example, two different Atmos components `myapp/1` and `myapp/2` can provide configuration
  for the same Terraform component `myapp`

All the above makes Atmos an ideal framework to organize infrastructure, to design for organizational complexity, and to provision multi-account
environments for very complex organizations.
