<Intro>
Atmos provides unlimited flexibility in defining and configuring stacks and components in the stacks.
</Intro>

<KeyPoints title="What you have learned">
- Terraform "root modules" are deployed as components that are organized in sub-folders within `components/terraform` by type, team, operations, or any other category.
- Stacks define the configuration of your "root modules", and can have arbitrary names and located anywhere in the `stacks/` directory; Atmos finds stacks using a "slug".
- Terraform components can be reused any number of times by giving them unique names in the stack configurations
  and pointing them to the same Terraform root module.
</KeyPoints>

All the above makes Atmos an ideal framework for organizing infrastructure, designing for organizational complexity, and provisioning multi-account environments for very complex organizations.

As you continue to poke around, here are some suggestions for what to do next:

1. [Review Atmos Design Patterns](/design-patterns)
2. [Use GitHub Actions](/integrations/github-actions)
3. [Try the Advanced Tutorial](/quick-start/advanced)
