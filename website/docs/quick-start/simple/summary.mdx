Atmos provides unlimited flexibility in defining and configuring stacks and components in the stacks.

<KeyPoints title="What you have learned">
- Terraform "root modules" are deployed as components that are organized in sub-folders within `components/terraform` by type, team, operations, or any other category.
- Stack define the configuration of your "root modules", and can have arbitrary names and be located anywhere in the `stacks/` directory; 
  Atmos finds stacks using a "slug" which is based on context variables like `namespace`, `tenant`, `environment`, and `stage`.
- Terraform components can be reused any number of times by giving them unique names in the stack configurations 
  and pointing them to the same Terraform root module.
</KeyPoints>

All the above makes Atmos an ideal framework to organize infrastructure, to design for organizational complexity, and to provision multi-account
environments for very complex organizations.
