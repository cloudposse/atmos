## Provision Atmos Components into all Stacks

Provision the `station` Atmos component into the stacks:

```shell
atmos terraform apply station -s dev

atmos terraform apply station -s staging

atmos terraform apply station -s prod
```

Alternatively, you can execute the configured [Atmos workflow](/quick-start/advanced/create-workflows) to provision all the components in all the stacks:

```shell
# Execute the workflow `apply-all-components` from the workflow manifest `networking`
atmos workflow apply-all-components -f networking
```

## Stack Search Algorithm

Looking at the commands above, you might have a question "How does Atmos find the component in the stack and all the variables?"

Let's consider what Atmos does when executing the command `atmos terraform apply station -s prod`:

- Atmos uses the `stacks.name_pattern` defined in the [CLI config](/quick-start/advanced/configure-cli). In this example, we have defined a simple name based on `stacks.name_pattern: "{stage}"`. This means that the stack name is just the `stage` part of the stack name.

- Atmos searches for the stack configuration file (in the `stacks` folder and all sub-folders) where `stage: prod` is defined (inline or via imports). During the search, Atmos processes all parent (top-level) config files and compares the context variables specified in the command (`-s` flag) with the context variables defined in the stack configurations, finally finding the matching stack

- Atmos finds the component `station` in the stack, processing all the inline configs and all the imports

- Atmos deep-merges all the catalog imports for the `station` component and then deep-merges all the variables for the component defined in all sections (global `vars`, terraform `vars`, base components `vars`, component `vars`), producing the final variables for the `station` component in the `prod` stack

- And lastly, Atmos writes the final deep-merged variables into a `.tfvar.json` file in the component directory and then
  executes `terraform apply -var-file ...` command
