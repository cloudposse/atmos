There are many ways to install Atmos.


To check what version of Atmos you have installed, just run `atmos version`.

To find the latest available version of Atmos, visit the [Releases Page](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/releases). The latest version will
always be available for download here.

Atmos has native packages for macOS and every major Linux distribution. We also supply binary releases for Windows.

    ```

    Grab a specific version:

    ```

    __NOTE:__ Since the version is passed in via `-ldflags` during build, when running `go install` without using `-ldflags`, the CLI will return `0.0.1`
    when running `atmos version`.

## Download Binaries from Releases Page

- Go to [Releases Page](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/releases)
- Download the binary for your operating system and architecture. Replace `${version}` with the desired version

  - e.g. If you’re on a Mac (M1/M2/M3), download the `atmos_${version}_darwin_arm64` binary
  - e.g. If you’re on an Intel Mac, download the `atmos_${version}_darwin_amd64` binary
  - e.g. If you’re on Windows, download `atmos_${version}_windows_amd64.exe`, etc.

- Rename the downloaded file to `atmos` (optional)
- Add the execution bit to the binary (e.g. on Linux and Mac, run `chmod u+x atmos`)
- Place the binary somewhere on your `PATH` (e.g. on Linux and Mac: `mv atmos /usr/local/bin/`)

## Set Up Your Terminal

Atmos is a modern CLI with a Text-based UI (TUI), as such, for the best experience we recommend ensuring you have
a decent terminal and modern fonts installed and configured in your terminal.

### TERM Environment Variable

As the standard terminal only supports 256 colors, we advise macOS users to use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) or any other modern day macOS terminal that supports ANSI characters.

Atmos uses ANSI color codes. These should work in every modern terminal, but you may have to set the `TERM` environment variable to `xterm-256color` for it to work.
This can be peristed in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file (or the respective RC file of whatever shell is in use).

```shell
export TERM=xterm-256color
```

:::tip Install NerdFonts
To display all icons used by `atmos`, we recommend the use of a Nerd Font.
:::

### NerdFonts

 Nerd Fonts are popular fonts that are patched to include icons.

The exact process will depend on your terminal and operating system, but the general idea is to install a font that
includes the necessary glyphs and then configure your terminal.

Go to https://www.nerdfonts.com/ for more information.

::tip
We recommend the "Fira Code" NerdFont version, which is what all our screenshots are based on.
