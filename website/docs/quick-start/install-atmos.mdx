<Intro>
There are many ways to install Atmos. Choose the method that works best for you!
</Intro>

To check what version of Atmos you have installed, just run `atmos version`. The latest version of Atmos is <LatestRelease />.

To find the latest available version of Atmos, visit the [Releases Page](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/releases). The latest version will always be available for download here.

## Using OS Package Managers

Atmos has native packages for macOS and every major Linux distribution. We also supply binary releases for Windows.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="macos" label="macOS" default>
    #### macOS (OSX)

    From Homebrew, install directly by running:

    ```shell
    brew install atmos
    ```

    #### Pro tip! Use a `Brewfile`

    Create a `Brewfile` in your [Atmos project](/core-concepts/projects), and add `brew "atmos"`. This way, you can ensure that everyone on your team is using the same version of Atmos.

    <File title="Brewfile">
    <pre><code>brew "atmos", "<LatestRelease />"</code></pre>
    </File>

    Then just run `brew install` in the same directory as the `Brewfile`.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="deb" label="Debian/Ubuntu">

    #### Debian Linux (DEB)

    On Debian, use the Cloud Posse package repository provided by Cloudsmith:

    ```shell
    # Add the Cloud Posse package repository hosted by Cloudsmith
    apt-get update && apt-get install -y apt-utils curl
    curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/cloudposse/packages/cfg/setup/bash.deb.sh' │ bash

    # Install atmos
    apt-get install atmos@="${ATMOS_VERSION}-*"
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="rpm" label="RedHat/CentOS">
    #### RedHat/CentOS Linux (RPM)

    On RedHat or CentOS, use the Cloud Posse package repository provided by Cloudsmith:

    curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/cloudposse/packages/setup.rpm.sh' │ sudo -E bash

    # Install atmos
    sudo yum install atmos-${ATMOS_VERSION}.x86_64
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="alpine" label="Alpine Linux">

    #### Alpine Linux (APK)
    On Alpine, use the Cloud Posse package repository provided by Cloudsmith:

    ```shell
    # Install the Cloud Posse package repository hosted by Cloudsmith
    curl -fsSL 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/cloudposse/packages/setup.alpine.sh' │ bash

    # Install atmos
    apk add atmos@cloudposse
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="nixos" label="NixOS">

    #### NixOS
    On NixOS, run the following command to install:

    ```shell
    nix-env -iA nixpkgs.atmos
    ```

    To get the latest version, you may need to update the Nix config to add "unstable" packages.

    For example, in `~/.config/nixpkgs/config.nix` add the following line to the file:

    ```console
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    ```

    Then run the following to install:

    ```shell
    nix-shell -p atmos
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="scoop" label="Windows">

    #### Windows via scoop.sh

    On Windows, run the following command to install:

    ```shell
    scoop install atmos

## Other Ways to Install

Atmos has a few other ways to install, including using Go, asdf, mise, aqua, building from source, or using the automatic installer.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="go" label="Go">
    #### Install with Go

    Install the latest version:

    ```shell
    go install github.com/cloudposse/atmos
    ```

    Grab a specific version:

    <CodeBlock language="shell">go install github.com/cloudposse/atmos@<LatestRelease /></CodeBlock>

    Or specifically request the latest version.

    ```shell
    go install github.com/cloudposse/atmos@latest
    ```

    __NOTE:__ Since the version is passed in via `-ldflags` during the build, when running `go install` without using `-ldflags`, the CLI will return `0.0.1` when running `atmos version`.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="asdf" label="asdf">
    #### Install with asdf

    Install plugin dependencies as listed in [asdf-atmos repository](https://github.com/cloudposse/asdf-atmos#dependencies):

    ```shell
    apt-get update && apt-get install -y bash curl tar
    ```

    Install the plugin:

    ```shell
    asdf plugin add atmos https://github.com/cloudposse/asdf-atmos.git
    ```

    Install a specified version:

    <CodeBlock language="shell">asdf install atmos <LatestRelease /></CodeBlock>

    Alternatively, create a `.tool-versions` file in your project to specify a consistent version for the users:
    <File title=".tool-versions">
      <pre>
        <code>
          atmos <LatestRelease />
        </code>
      </pre>
    </File>

    Then, run `asdf install` in the same directory.

    __NOTE:__ Don't have `asdf`? Install it first from [here](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html)
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="mise" label="Mise">
    #### Install with Mise

    Install a specified version:
    <CodeBlock language="shell">mise use atmos@<LatestRelease /></CodeBlock>

    Alternatively, create a `.mise.toml` file in your repository to specify a consistent version for the users:
    <File title=".mise.toml">
      <pre>
        <code>
          [tools]
          atmos = '<LatestRelease />'
        </code>
      </pre>
    </File>

    Then, run `mise install` in the same directory.

    __NOTE:__ Don't have `mise`? Install it first from [here](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html)
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="aqua" label="aqua">
    #### Install with aqua

    [aqua](https://aquaproj.github.io/) is a CLI Version Manager.
    aqua allows you to manage multiple versions of CLI tools, making it easy to switch between different versions of Atmos and other tools in your projects.

    Create `aqua.yaml` by `aqua init`:

    ```shell
    aqua init
    ```

    Add atmos to aqua.yaml:

    ```shell
    aqua g -i cloudposse/atmos
    ```

    Then, run `aqua install` in the same directory.

    __NOTE:__ Don't have `aqua`? Install it first from [here](https://aquaproj.github.io/docs/install)
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="source" label="From Source">
    #### Build from Source

    ```shell
    make build
    ```

    or run this and replace `$version` with the version that should be returned with `atmos version`.

    ```shell
    go build -o build/atmos -v -ldflags "-X 'github.com/cloudposse/atmos/pkg/version.Version=$version'"
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="installer" label="Automatic Installer">
    #### Automatic Installer

    If you're not sure which method to use, you can always use the automatic installer. It will figure out which
    of the mechanisms above to use, and perform it.

    Paste the following into a macOS Terminal or Linux shell prompt.

    ```shell
    curl -fsSL https://atmos.tools/install.sh | bash
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
The latest version of Atmos (<LatestRelease />) might not be available with third-party package managers.

## Download Binaries from Releases Page

- Go to [Releases Page](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/releases)
- Download the binary for your operating system and architecture. Replace `${version}` with the desired version

  - e.g. If you’re on a Mac (M1/M2/M3), download the `atmos_${version}_darwin_arm64` binary
  - e.g. If you’re on an Intel Mac, download the `atmos_${version}_darwin_amd64` binary
  - e.g. If you’re on Windows, download `atmos_${version}_windows_amd64.exe`, etc.

- Rename the downloaded file to `atmos` (optional)
- Add the execution bit to the binary (e.g. on Linux and Mac, run `chmod u+x atmos`)
- Place the binary somewhere on your `PATH` (e.g. on Linux and Mac: `mv atmos /usr/local/bin/`)

## Set Up Your Terminal

Atmos is a modern CLI with a Text-based UI (TUI), as such, for the best experience we recommend ensuring you have
a decent terminal and modern fonts installed and configured in your terminal.

### TERM Environment Variable

Atmos uses ANSI color codes. These should work in every modern terminal, including the default terminal shipped with
macOS. You *may* have to set the `TERM` environment variable to `xterm-256color` for it to work.
This can be persisted in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file (or the respective RC file of whatever shell is in use).

```shell
export TERM=xterm-256color
```

If you're having any troule, try [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) or any other modern day terminal that supports
ANSI characters and fonts.

:::tip Install NerdFonts
To display all icons used by `atmos`, we recommend the use of a Nerd Font, like *Fira Code*.
:::

### NerdFonts

 Nerd Fonts are popular fonts that are patched to include icons.

The exact process will depend on your terminal and operating system, but the general idea is to install a font that
includes the necessary glyphs and then configure your terminal.

Go to https://www.nerdfonts.com/ for more information.

:::tip
We recommend the "Fira Code" NerdFont version, which is what all our screenshots are based on.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="homebrew-cask-fonts" label="Homebrew">
    #### Homebrew

    If you're using Homebrew, you can tap the `homebrew-cask-fonts` repository to install Nerd Fonts.

    Paste the following into a macOS Terminal window.

    ```shell
    brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts     # You only need to do this once!
    brew search nerd-font            # Search for font packages

    # Install the NerdFont version of Fira Code
    brew install --cask font-fira-code-nerd-font
    ```
