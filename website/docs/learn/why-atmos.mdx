<Intro>
Atmos is a framework that helps teams succeed with Terraform from day one. It provides proven patterns, conventions, and tooling to manage complex, multi-environment infrastructure without the growing pains.
</Intro>

## The Challenge

As Terraform infrastructure grows, teams encounter predictable challenges:

- **Configuration sprawl**: Duplicate code across environments (dev, staging, prod)
- **Complexity growth**: Managing dozens or hundreds of AWS accounts and regions
- **Team coordination**: Multiple teams working on shared infrastructure
- **Consistency**: Ensuring standards and security policies across all deployments

Most teams solve these problems by trial and error, progressing through stages of increasing sophistication. This journey can take months or years, with each stage introducing new complexities.

## The Atmos Approach

Atmos lets you skip ahead by providing a complete framework with:

**Separation of Configuration from Code**
- Keep your Terraform components generic and reusable
- Configure environments with YAML, not code duplication
- Components work anywhere without modification

**DRY Without Templates**
- Deep-merge configurations for inheritance
- Import shared settings across stacks
- Override specific values where needed
- No code generation or messy templating

**Built for Scale**
- Manage hundreds of environments from a single repository
- Multi-account, multi-region, multi-tenant patterns
- Component catalogs for standardization
- Workflow orchestration for complex deployments

**Enterprise-Ready**
- Validation with OPA and JSON Schema
- GitOps integration (GitHub Actions, Spacelift, Atlantis)
- Vendoring for supply chain management
- Comprehensive CLI for all operations

## When to Use Atmos

Atmos is ideal when you need to:

- **Manage multiple environments** (dev, staging, prod across regions)
- **Scale Terraform** across teams and accounts
- **Enforce consistency** without code duplication
- **Reduce configuration complexity** as infrastructure grows

If you're managing a single environment or simple infrastructure, vanilla Terraform might be sufficient. But when you find yourself copying and pasting configurations or struggling with environment management, it's time for Atmos.

## Your Journey with Atmos

Most Terraform teams progress through 10+ stages of maturityâ€”from ClickOps to enterprise scale. Each stage solves previous problems but introduces new complexity.

**Atmos helps you skip these growing pains** by providing battle-tested solutions for every stage.
