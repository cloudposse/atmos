<Intro>
You've completed the Learn Atmos path! You understand components, stacks, YAML configuration, imports, inheritance, organization, and how to connect components. Now let's explore what's next.
</Intro>

## What You've Learned

Over the last 8 pages, you've built a solid foundation in Atmos:

✅ **Why Atmos exists** - Solving configuration complexity for enterprise infrastructure
✅ **Core concepts** - Components, stacks, and separation of configuration from code
✅ **Your first stack** - A working example from scratch
✅ **YAML in Atmos** - Scope, deep merge, tags vs templates
✅ **Imports** - Reusing configuration across stacks
✅ **Inheritance** - Creating component variations without duplication
✅ **Organization** - Structuring stacks for maintainability and scale
✅ **Connecting components** - Sharing data via remote state

This is enough to build real infrastructure with Atmos. Everything else is refinement.

## Learn Advanced Techniques

Ready to level up? Explore advanced Atmos features:

<ActionCard>
### Advanced Stack Configuration

Go deeper into stack mechanics:

- **[Advanced Imports](/stacks/imports)** - Templates, context, and dynamic imports
- **[Multiple Inheritance](/stacks/inheritance)** - Mixins and hierarchical inheritance
- **[Stack Dependencies](/stacks/dependencies)** - Explicit component ordering
- **[Stack Overrides](/stacks/overrides)** - Selective configuration replacement
- **[Stack Hooks](/stacks/hooks)** - Run commands before/after operations

### Templates & Functions

Learn Atmos templating:

- **[YAML Functions](/functions/yaml/)** - Native YAML extensions
- **[Template Functions](/functions/template/)** - Go template functions
- **[Gomplate Integration](/templates/)** - Advanced templating with datasources

<PrimaryCTA to="/functions/">Explore Functions</PrimaryCTA>
</ActionCard>

### Workflows

Automate complex deployments:

- **[Workflow Basics](/workflows)** - Multi-step automation
- **[Workflow Orchestration](/workflows)** - Conditional logic and error handling
- **[Custom Commands](/cli/configuration/commands)** - Extend Atmos with your own commands

### Validation & Policy

Enforce standards and prevent errors:

- **[Schema Validation](/cli/commands/validate/schema)** - JSON Schema for stack configurations
- **[OPA Policies](/cli/commands/validate/stacks)** - Policy-as-code with Open Policy Agent
- **[Component Validation](/cli/commands/validate/component)** - Validate before deployment

### Vendoring

Manage external components:

- **[Vendor Configuration](/vendoring/vendor)** - Pull components from remote sources
- **[Component Libraries](/vendoring/component-manifest)** - Share components across teams
- **[Version Management](/vendoring/vendor-manifest)** - Lock dependencies for consistency

- **[Blog](https://cloudposse.com/blog/)** - Deep dives and tutorials

## What to Build

Here are some projects to solidify your learning:

### Beginner Projects

1. **Multi-environment VPC** - Deploy the same VPC to dev, staging, prod with different CIDR blocks
2. **Shared services architecture** - Central account with shared RDS, accessed by app accounts
3. **Component library** - Create abstract base components for your team to inherit from

### Intermediate Projects

1. **Multi-region deployment** - Same stack across multiple AWS regions
2. **Custom workflow** - Automate deployment of 5+ dependent components in order
3. **Validation policies** - OPA policies enforcing naming conventions and tagging

### Advanced Projects

1. **Multi-cloud architecture** - AWS and GCP components in the same stack
2. **GitOps pipeline** - Automated Atmos deployment via GitHub Actions
3. **Component vendoring** - Pull and customize external component libraries

## You're Ready

You have everything you need to build production infrastructure with Atmos. The rest is practice and refinement.

**Start small.** Deploy a VPC. Add an EKS cluster. Connect them. Build from there.

**Keep it simple.** Use advanced features when you need them, not before.

**Ask for help.** The community is friendly and responsive.

Welcome to the Atmos community. We're excited to see what you build! 🚀
