This folder contains the website powering official [atmos](https://atmos.tools) documentation.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies by running `brew bundle install`. This command will look for the `Brewfile` and installs its contents.
2. Start the NPM dependencies by running `npm install`
3. Start the local web server by running `npm run start`

The shortcut for running all these commands is to just run `make all`
