## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies by running `brew bundle install`. This command will look for the `Brewfile` and install its
   contents.
2. Start the NPM dependencies by running `npm install`
3. Build the local search base by running `npm run build`
4. Start the local web server by running `npm run start`

The shortcut for running all these commands is just to run `make all`
