## What Are Themes?

Themes control the colors, styles, and visual presentation of Atmos terminal output. They affect markdown rendering, table formatting, syntax highlighting, and status messages to provide a consistent look across all commands.

## Browse Available Themes

View the complete collection of themes in the [theme gallery](/cli/commands/theme/browse). The gallery includes a visual preview of each theme's color palette and supports search by name, type (dark/light), or author.

## Using Themes

List all available themes:

```bash
atmos theme list
```

Preview a specific theme:

```bash
atmos theme show dracula
```

## Configure Your Theme

Set a theme in your `atmos.yaml`:

```yaml
settings:
  terminal:
    theme: dracula
```

Or use an environment variable:

```bash
export ATMOS_THEME=dracula
atmos terraform plan
```
