Atmos workflows now support 18 step types that transform static automation scripts into guided, user-friendly experiences. Build deployment wizards, collect input securely, display rich feedback, and create self-documenting runbooks—all within your existing workflow YAML.

## What Changed

Workflows have evolved from simple command runners into a full-featured automation framework with a registry-based architecture supporting four categories of step types:

**Interactive Steps** (require TTY):
- `input` - Text input with placeholder, default value, and password masking
- `choose` - Single-select from a list of options
- `filter` - Searchable multi-select with fuzzy matching
- `confirm` - Yes/no confirmation prompts
- `file` - File browser with extension filtering
- `write` - Multi-line text editor

**Output Steps**:
- `table` - Structured data in formatted tables
- `format` - Apply Go templates to transform data
- `join` - Combine values with custom separators

**UI Steps**:
- `toast` - Status messages with success/info/warning/error levels
- `markdown` - Rich markdown rendering with syntax highlighting
- `style` - Styled containers with borders, padding, and markdown support
- `linebreak` - Visual spacing between sections
- `pager` - Scrollable file viewer with search
- `log` - Structured logging with levels and fields

**Command Steps**:
- `atmos` - Execute atmos commands
- `shell` - Run shell commands
- `spin` - Commands with animated progress spinner

## Why This Matters

Infrastructure automation often requires human judgment—confirming destructive operations, selecting environments, or providing deployment notes. Previously, teams had to build custom tooling or rely on external scripts. Now you can:

1. **Guide users through complex operations** with step-by-step wizards
2. **Collect and validate input** before executing changes
3. **Pass data between steps** using Go templates (`{{ .steps.select_env.value }}`)
4. **Access environment variables** directly (`{{ .env.USER }}`)
5. **Provide rich feedback** with styled output and progress indicators

## How to Use It

Here's a deployment workflow that collects environment, components, and notes before executing:

```yaml
workflows:
  deploy:
    description: Interactive deployment with confirmation
    steps:
      - name: welcome
        type: markdown
        content: |
          # Deployment Wizard
          Select your target environment and components.

      - name: environment
        type: choose
        prompt: "Select target environment"
        options: [dev, staging, prod]

      - name: components
        type: filter
        prompt: "Select components to deploy"
        multiple: true
        options: [vpc, eks, rds, monitoring]

      - name: notes
        type: input
        prompt: "Deployment notes"
        placeholder: "Brief description of changes"

      - name: confirm
        type: confirm
        prompt: |
          Deploy {{ len .steps.components.values }} components to {{ .steps.environment.value }}?

      - name: deploying
        type: spin
        title: "Deploying..."
        command: "atmos terraform apply {{ .steps.components.values | join \" \" }} -s {{ .steps.environment.value }}"

      - name: done
        type: toast
        level: success
        content: "Deployment complete!"
```

Run with:

```shell
atmos workflow deploy -f your-workflow-file
```
