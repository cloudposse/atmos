Atmos now includes a unified import adapter registry that provides a modular, extensible architecture for configuration imports.

<!--truncate-->

## What Changed

The import system has been refactored to use an adapter-based registry pattern:

- **GoGetterAdapter** handles all remote imports (http://, https://, git::, s3::, gcs::, oci://, etc.)
- **LocalAdapter** handles local filesystem paths
- **MockAdapter** provides synthetic YAML generation for testing

This replaces the previous if/else chain with a clean, extensible registry that routes imports to the appropriate adapter based on URL scheme.

## Why This Matters

The new architecture:

- **Fixes go-getter routing** - All go-getter schemes now work correctly (git::, s3::, gcs::, oci://, etc.)
- **Enables extensibility** - New import schemes can be added by implementing the `ImportAdapter` interface
- **Improves testability** - The `mock://` scheme enables testing without external dependencies
- **Follows established patterns** - Consistent with the command registry and store registry patterns

## How to Use It

Existing imports continue to work unchanged. The new architecture is transparent to users while enabling future extensibility like `terragrunt://` for HCL-to-YAML transformation.
