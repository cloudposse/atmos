The `atmos toolchain list` command now displays tool entries correctly and provides helpful error messages when configuration is missing.

## What Changed

This release fixes several issues with the toolchain list command that were preventing tools from being displayed and providing confusing error messages.

### Fixed Table Display

The toolchain list command was showing only the table header without any data rows, even when tools were configured in `.tool-versions`. This was caused by an off-by-one error in the bubbles table component configuration. The command now correctly displays all configured tools with their installation status.

### Improved Error Messages

When running `atmos toolchain list` without a `.tool-versions` file, the command previously showed a confusing "not valid usage" error message. Now it displays a helpful markdown-formatted message with clear instructions:

```
# No Configuration Found

No .tool-versions file found at: .tool-versions

## To get started:

Add a tool to automatically create your configuration:

atmos toolchain add terraform@1.6.0

Then list your tools:

atmos toolchain list
```

### UI System Migration

All toolchain output has been migrated to use the new `ui.*` functions instead of the deprecated `u.Print*` methods. This ensures consistent formatting across all commands and proper rendering to stderr/stdout channels.

## Impact

These changes improve the developer experience when working with Atmos toolchain management by:
- Making it immediately clear when no tools are configured
- Guiding users to the correct workflow (`atmos toolchain add`) instead of manual file editing
- Ensuring all configured tools are visible in the list output
- Providing consistent, well-formatted output across all toolchain commands

## Upgrade Notes

No action required—this fix is backward compatible with existing `.tool-versions` files.
