The `--skip-init` flag is now properly honored for `atmos terraform output` and other simple terraform subcommands. Previously, the flag was ignored due to a regression in the flag parsing infrastructure.

<!--truncate-->

## The Problem

Starting in version 1.202.0, running `atmos terraform output` with the `--skip-init` flag would still execute `terraform init`:

```bash
# Expected: Skip init and just run output
atmos terraform output mycomponent -s mystack --skip-init

# Actual behavior (bug): Init still ran
Initializing the backend...
Initializing provider plugins...
```

This was problematic for CI/CD pipelines and workflows where initialization had already been performed, causing unnecessary delays and potential issues with backend configuration.

## The Fix

The `--skip-init` flag is now correctly parsed and applied to the execution flow. When specified, Atmos skips the `terraform init` step:

```bash
atmos terraform output mycomponent -s mystack --skip-init
# Output values are returned directly without initialization
```

## Root Cause

The flag was registered in the CLI but was not being transferred from the Viper configuration to the execution context. This affected simple terraform subcommands that use the shared flag parser, including `output`, `show`, `state`, and others.

## Upgrade

Upgrade Atmos to get this fix. No configuration changes are required.
