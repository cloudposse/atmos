Atmos now supports `atmos vendor list` and `atmos workflow list` as aliases for their `atmos list vendor` and `atmos list workflows` counterparts.

<!--truncate-->

## What Changed

Two new command aliases make discoverability more intuitive:

- `atmos vendor list` is now an alias for `atmos list vendor`
- `atmos workflow list` is now an alias for `atmos list workflows`

Both command forms are equivalent and share the same flags, completions, and output.

## Why This Matters

Users naturally expect list commands under the parent command (e.g., `atmos vendor list`), while Atmos organizes all list commands under `atmos list`. This bidirectional aliasing follows the same pattern as `atmos list themes` and `atmos theme list`.

## How to Use It

Both forms work identically:

```bash
# These are equivalent
atmos vendor list
atmos list vendor

# These are equivalent
atmos workflow list
atmos list workflows

# All flags work the same
atmos vendor list --format json
atmos workflow list --format csv
```
