Metadata now inherits from base components, just like `vars` and `settings`.

<!--truncate-->

## The Problem

When managing infrastructure at scale, you want to enforce consistent governance policies across your components. Lock production components to prevent accidental changes. Use standardized workspace naming patterns. Apply the same metadata settings everywhere.

But before this release, `metadata` didn't inherit from base components. Even though you could inherit `vars` and `settings`, you had to copy-paste metadata configuration to every derived component:

```yaml
# You defined governance once...
vpc/defaults:
  metadata:
    locked: true
    terraform_workspace_pattern: "{tenant}-{environment}-{stage}"

# ...but had to repeat it everywhere
vpc-prod:
  metadata:
    inherits: [vpc/defaults]
    locked: true                        # Repeated
    terraform_workspace_pattern: "..."  # Repeated

vpc-staging:
  metadata:
    inherits: [vpc/defaults]
    locked: true                        # Repeated again
    terraform_workspace_pattern: "..."  # Repeated again
```

This made governance settings harder to maintain and easier to forget.

## The Solution

Now it just works:

```yaml
vpc/defaults:
  metadata:
    type: abstract
    locked: true
    terraform_workspace_pattern: "{tenant}-{environment}-{stage}"

vpc-prod:
  metadata:
    inherits: [vpc/defaults]
    # locked and terraform_workspace_pattern are inherited
```

The only field that doesn't inherit is `metadata.inherits` itself.

## Configuration

Metadata inheritance is now enabled by default. If this causes issues with existing configurations, you can disable it:

```yaml
# atmos.yaml
stacks:
  inherit:
    metadata: false
```

See the [inheritance documentation](/core-concepts/stacks/inheritance) for details.
