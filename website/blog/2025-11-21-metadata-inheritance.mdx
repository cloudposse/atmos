Metadata now inherits from base components, just like `vars` and `settings`.

## The Problem

When managing infrastructure at scale, you want to enforce consistent governance policies across your components. Pin all instances to the same component version. Lock critical infrastructure to prevent accidental changes. Use standardized workspace naming patterns. Document component ownership.

But before this release, `metadata` didn't inherit from base components. Even though you could inherit `vars` and `settings`, you had to copy-paste metadata configuration to every derived component:

```yaml
# You defined governance once...
vpc/defaults:
  metadata:
    type: abstract
    component: vpc/v2                                             # Pin to version
    locked: true
    terraform_workspace_pattern: "{tenant}-{environment}-{stage}"
    description: "Virtual Private Cloud network configuration"
    owner: "platform-team"

# ...but had to repeat EVERYTHING for each instance
vpc/primary:
  metadata:
    inherits: [vpc/defaults]
    component: vpc/v2                                             # Repeated
    locked: true                                                  # Repeated
    terraform_workspace_pattern: "{tenant}-{environment}-{stage}" # Repeated
    description: "Virtual Private Cloud network configuration"    # Repeated
    owner: "platform-team"                                        # Repeated

vpc/secondary:
  metadata:
    inherits: [vpc/defaults]
    component: vpc/v2                                             # Repeated again
    locked: true                                                  # Repeated again
    terraform_workspace_pattern: "{tenant}-{environment}-{stage}" # Repeated again
    description: "Virtual Private Cloud network configuration"    # Repeated again
    owner: "platform-team"                                        # Repeated again
```

The biggest pain? When upgrading to `vpc/v3`, you had to update the component version in every single instance. Miss one, and you'd have components running different versions with no indication why.

## The Solution

Now it just works:

```yaml
vpc/defaults:
  metadata:
    type: abstract
    component: vpc/v2                                             # Define version once
    locked: true
    terraform_workspace_pattern: "{tenant}-{environment}-{stage}"
    description: "Virtual Private Cloud network configuration"
    owner: "platform-team"

vpc/primary:
  metadata:
    inherits: [vpc/defaults]
    # component, locked, terraform_workspace_pattern, description, and owner are all inherited

vpc/secondary:
  metadata:
    inherits: [vpc/defaults]
    # All governance settings inherited - no repetition needed
```

Want to upgrade to `vpc/v3`? Change it once in `vpc/defaults`, and all instances inherit the new version automatically.

The only field that doesn't inherit is `metadata.inherits` itself.

## Configuration

Metadata inheritance is now enabled by default. If this causes issues with existing configurations, you can disable it:

```yaml
# atmos.yaml
stacks:
  inherit:
    metadata: false
```

See the [inheritance documentation](/core-concepts/stacks/inheritance) for details.
