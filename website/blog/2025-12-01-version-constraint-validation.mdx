Atmos now supports version constraint validation, allowing you to specify required Atmos version ranges in your `atmos.yaml` configuration. When your configuration requires specific features or behaviors, you can ensure all team members and CI/CD pipelines use compatible Atmos versions.

## The Problem

Teams using Atmos often face version consistency challenges:

- **Feature availability** - Newer configurations may use features that don't exist in older Atmos versions
- **Breaking changes** - Running an incompatible version can cause confusing errors
- **Environment drift** - CI pipelines, local development, and containers may run different versions
- **No clear signal** - Users don't know when upgrading is required vs. recommended

## The Solution

Add a `version.constraint` section to your `atmos.yaml`:

```yaml
version:
  constraint:
    require: ">=1.100.0, <2.0.0"
    enforcement: "fatal"
    message: "Please upgrade Atmos to continue."
```

Atmos validates the constraint at startup. If the current version doesn't satisfy the requirement:

- **`fatal`** (default) - Exit with a helpful error message
- **`warn`** - Show a warning and continue
- **`silent`** - Skip validation (for debugging)

## Constraint Syntax

Uses the same syntax as Terraform version constraints:

| Constraint | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| `>=1.100.0` | Minimum version |
| `<2.0.0` | Maximum version (exclusive) |
| `>=1.100.0, <2.0.0` | Version range |
| `~>1.100` | Pessimistic (>=1.100.0, &lt;2.0.0) |
| `!=1.150.0` | Exclude specific version |

## Override for Debugging

Use the environment variable to temporarily bypass constraints:

```bash
ATMOS_VERSION_ENFORCEMENT=warn atmos terraform plan
```

## Get Started

Add version constraints to your `atmos.yaml` today to ensure consistent Atmos versions across your team and infrastructure.

See the [Version Constraints documentation](/cli/configuration/version/constraint) for complete details.
