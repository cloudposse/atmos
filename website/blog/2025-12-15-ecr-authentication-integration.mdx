We're introducing ECR authentication integration - automatic Docker login for AWS Elastic Container Registry as part of your Atmos authentication workflow. Configure once, authenticate everywhere.

{/* truncate */}

## The Problem

Teams working with AWS ECR face repetitive authentication friction:

```bash
# The manual dance everyone knows too well
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

This breaks down when you have:

- Multiple AWS accounts with different ECR registries
- Different identities for different environments
- Team members who forget the exact incantation
- CI/CD pipelines that need consistent authentication

## The Solution: Integrations

We've introduced a new `auth.integrations` section that handles **client-only credential materializations** - services like ECR and EKS that derive credentials from your AWS identity rather than being identities themselves.

### Configuration

```yaml
auth:
  providers:
    company-sso:
      kind: aws/iam-identity-center
      region: us-east-1
      start_url: https://company.awsapps.com/start/

  identities:
    dev-admin:
      kind: aws/permission-set
      via:
        provider: company-sso
      principal:
        name: AdministratorAccess
        account: dev

  # Integrations specify which identity they use via "via.identity"
  # auto_provision defaults to true, so integrations auto-trigger on identity login
  integrations:
    dev/ecr/primary:
      kind: aws/ecr
      via:
        identity: dev-admin
      spec:
        registry:
          account_id: "123456789012"
          region: us-east-2

    dev/ecr/secondary:
      kind: aws/ecr
      via:
        identity: dev-admin
      spec:
        registry:
          account_id: "123456789012"
          region: us-west-2
```

### Automatic Login

When you authenticate with an identity, all integrations that reference that identity are triggered automatically (auto_provision defaults to true):

```bash
$ atmos auth login dev-admin
Authenticating with identity: dev-admin
Opening browser for SSO authentication...
Successfully authenticated as dev-admin
✓ ECR login: 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com (expires in 11h59m)
✓ ECR login: 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com (expires in 11h59m)
```

### Standalone ECR Login

You can also trigger ECR login independently:

```bash
# Using a named integration
atmos auth ecr-login dev/ecr/primary

# Using an identity's linked integrations (all integrations referencing that identity)
atmos auth ecr-login --identity dev-admin

# Explicit registries (ad-hoc)
atmos auth ecr-login --registry 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

## Design Decisions

### Why Integrations, Not Identities?

ECR login and EKS kubeconfig aren't really "identities" - they're derived credentials:

| Concept                     | IAM User | Docker Login (ECR) | EKS kubeconfig |
|-----------------------------|----------|---------------------|----------------|
| Stored identity object      | Yes      | No                  | No             |
| Policy attachment           | Yes      | No                  | No             |
| Server-side lifecycle       | Yes      | No                  | No             |
| Client-only materialization | No       | Yes                 | Yes            |

Integrations are things that **use** an identity to materialize client-side credentials.

### Isolated Docker Config

ECR credentials are written to `~/.config/atmos/docker/config.json` (following XDG conventions), not your default Docker config. This keeps Atmos-managed credentials separate from manually configured registries.

### Non-Blocking Errors

Integration failures during `atmos auth login` are logged but don't block authentication. Your identity credentials succeed even if ECR login fails - you can retry the integration separately.

## Use Cases

### Multi-Account Container Workflows

```yaml
auth:
  identities:
    prod-deployer:
      kind: aws/permission-set
      via:
        provider: company-sso
      principal:
        name: ContainerDeploy
        account: production

  # auto_provision defaults to true - integrations trigger on identity login
  integrations:
    prod/ecr:
      kind: aws/ecr
      via:
        identity: prod-deployer
      spec:
        registry:
          account_id: "111111111111"
          region: us-east-1

    shared/ecr:
      kind: aws/ecr
      via:
        identity: prod-deployer
      spec:
        registry:
          account_id: "999999999999"
          region: us-east-1
```

### CI/CD Pipelines

```bash
# Single command authenticates identity AND logs into ECR
atmos auth login prod-deployer

# Now docker pull/push works
docker pull 111111111111.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-app:latest
```

## What's Next

The integration pattern extends naturally to other client-only credential materializations:

- **EKS**: `aws eks update-kubeconfig` integration
- **CodeArtifact**: npm/pip repository authentication
- **Other registries**: GCR, ACR support
