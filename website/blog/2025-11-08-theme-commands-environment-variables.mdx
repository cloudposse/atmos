The theme commands have been migrated to use the modern `StandardFlagParser` infrastructure, bringing them in line with other Atmos commands.

<!--truncate-->

## For Atmos Contributors

This change has **zero user impact** but improves internal code consistency. The theme commands now use the same flag parsing pattern as `terraform`, `helmfile`, and `packer` commands.

## What Changed

The theme commands have been migrated to use the `StandardFlagParser` pattern, enabling environment variable support and consistent flag precedence across all Atmos commands.

## Usage

```bash
# Use environment variable
export ATMOS_THEME_RECOMMENDED=true
atmos theme list

# CLI flag overrides environment variable
atmos theme list --recommended=false
```

## Benefits

- **Environment variable support**: Set `ATMOS_THEME_RECOMMENDED=true` to filter recommended themes
- **Flag precedence**: CLI flags > environment variables > config files > defaults
- **Consistency**: Same pattern as `terraform`, `helmfile`, and `packer` commands
- **Type safety**: Removed global variables in favor of type-safe options structs
