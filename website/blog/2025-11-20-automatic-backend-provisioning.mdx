We're excited to introduce **automatic backend provisioning** in Atmos, a feature that eliminates the chicken-and-egg problem of managing Terraform state backends. No more manual S3 bucket creation, no more separate Terraform modules just to bootstrap your state storage—Atmos now handles it automatically.

## The Problem: State Backend Bootstrapping

Every Terraform project faces the same bootstrapping challenge: before you can manage infrastructure, you need somewhere to store your state. The typical workflow looks like this:

1. Manually create an S3 bucket via AWS Console or CLI
2. Configure bucket versioning, encryption, and public access blocking
3. Set up DynamoDB table for state locking (optional with Terraform 1.10+)
4. Finally, start using Terraform

This creates friction for new projects, complicates CI/CD pipelines, and introduces manual steps that conflict with infrastructure-as-code principles.

## The Solution: Automatic Provisioning

Atmos now provisions backends automatically when needed. Just enable it in your stack configuration:

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    vpc:
      backend_type: s3  # Must be at component level

      backend:
        bucket: my-terraform-state
        key: vpc/terraform.tfstate
        region: us-east-1

      provision:
        backend:
          enabled: true  # That's it!
```

When you run `atmos terraform plan vpc -s dev`, Atmos:

1. **Checks** if the backend exists
2. **Provisions** it if needed (with secure defaults)
3. **Initializes** Terraform
4. **Continues** with your command

All automatically. No manual intervention required.

## Configuration Flexibility

The `provision.backend` configuration works with Atmos's inheritance system, allowing you to set defaults at any level (organization, environment, component) and override when needed. For example, enable automatic provisioning for all development environments while keeping production backends pre-provisioned.

## Secure by Default

The S3 backend provisioner applies hardcoded security best practices:

- ✅ **Versioning enabled** - Protect against accidental deletions
- ✅ **AES-256 encryption** - AWS-managed keys, always enabled
- ✅ **Public access blocked** - All four block settings enabled
- ✅ **Native S3 locking** - Terraform 1.10+ support (no DynamoDB needed)
- ✅ **Resource tags** - Automatic tagging for cost allocation

These settings aren't configurable—they're opinionated defaults that follow AWS security best practices.

## Solves the Terraform Bootstrap Problem

Automatic provisioning is **fully compatible with Terraform-managed backends**. In fact, it solves a classic chicken-and-egg problem: "How do I manage my state backend with Terraform when I need that backend to exist before Terraform can run?"

**The traditional workaround:**
1. Use local state temporarily
2. Create S3 bucket with Terraform using local state
3. Switch backend configuration to S3
4. Import the bucket into the S3-backed state
5. Delete local state files

**With Atmos automatic provisioning:**
1. Enable `provision.backend.enabled: true`
2. Run `atmos terraform plan` - bucket auto-created with secure defaults
3. Import the bucket into Terraform (no local state dance needed)
4. Disable `provision.backend.enabled: false`
5. Done - everything managed by Terraform

**Import the provisioned backend:**

```hcl
import {
  to = aws_s3_bucket.terraform_state
  id = "my-terraform-state"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "terraform_state" {
  bucket = "my-terraform-state"
}

# Add any additional configuration
resource "aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration" "terraform_state" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.terraform_state.id

  rule {
    id     = "delete-old-versions"
    status = "Enabled"

    noncurrent_version_expiration {
      noncurrent_days = 90
    }
  }
}
```

Then disable automatic provisioning since Terraform now manages it:

```yaml
provision:
  backend:
    enabled: false  # Terraform manages this now
```

This **eliminates the bootstrap hack** and makes it easier to manage everything with Terraform, not harder. The provisioner creates standard AWS resources that Terraform can import and manage - no special handling required.

## Cross-Account Support

Provisioners integrate with Atmos AuthManager for cross-account operations:

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    vpc:
      backend:
        bucket: my-terraform-state
        region: us-east-1
        assume_role:
          role_arn: arn:aws:iam::999999999999:role/TerraformStateAdmin

      provision:
        backend:
          enabled: true
```

The provisioner automatically assumes the role to create the bucket in the target account.

## CLI Command

For manual provisioning or CI/CD pipelines, use the new `atmos provision` command:

```bash
# Provision backend explicitly
atmos provision backend vpc --stack dev

# Automatic in CI/CD
atmos provision backend vpc --stack dev
atmos provision backend eks --stack dev
atmos terraform apply vpc --stack dev  # Only runs if provisioning succeeded
```

Provisioning failures return non-zero exit codes, ensuring CI/CD pipelines fail fast.

## Extensible Architecture

The provisioner system is built on a **self-registering architecture** that makes it easy to add support for additional backend types and provisioner types in the future

Backend provisioners register themselves and declare when they should run via hook events:

```go
// Register S3 backend provisioner
provisioner.RegisterProvisioner(provisioner.Provisioner{
    Type:      "backend",
    HookEvent: "before.terraform.init",
    Func:      ProvisionS3Backend,
})
```

## Getting Started

Enable automatic backend provisioning in your stack configuration:

```yaml
# stacks/dev.yaml
components:
  terraform:
    vpc:
      backend_type: s3  # Must be at component level

      backend:
        bucket: acme-terraform-state-dev
        key: vpc/terraform.tfstate
        region: us-east-1

      provision:
        backend:
          enabled: true
```

Then run your Terraform commands as usual:

```bash
atmos terraform plan vpc -s dev
# Backend provisioned automatically if needed
```
