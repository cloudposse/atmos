# Making Errors Work For You: Enhanced Error Handling in Atmos

We're excited to announce a major improvement to how Atmos handles and reports errors. This enhancement focuses on making errors more helpful, more actionable, and more observableâ€”so you spend less time debugging and more time shipping.

## The Problem: Generic Errors Don't Help

If you've worked with complex infrastructure tooling, you've probably encountered errors like this:

```
Error: failed to process component
```

What failed? Why did it fail? What should you do about it? These generic errors force you to dig through logs, check configurations, and experiment with fixesâ€”wasting precious time.

## Our Solution: Errors That Guide You

We've redesigned Atmos error handling from the ground up with three core principles:

### 1. Rich Context

Every error now includes detailed context about what was happening when it failed:

```
Error: component not found in stack

Explanation:
Component 'vpc' could not be found in stack 'prod/us-east-1'

Context:
  component: vpc
  stack: prod/us-east-1
  config_file: stacks/prod/us-east-1.yaml

Hints:
ðŸ’¡ Use 'atmos list components --stack prod/us-east-1' to see available components
ðŸ’¡ Check that the component is defined in your stack configuration
```

No more guessing what went wrongâ€”the error tells you exactly what happened and where.

### 2. Actionable Hints

The most frustrating errors are the ones that don't tell you how to fix them. Every Atmos error now includes specific, actionable hints:

- **Commands to run** to investigate the issue
- **Configuration to check** that might be misconfigured
- **Links to documentation** for complex scenarios
- **Next steps** to resolve the problem

These aren't generic suggestionsâ€”they're context-aware guidance based on the specific error and your configuration.

### 3. Observability with Sentry Integration

The best error messages help you fix problems before users report them. That's why we've integrated Sentry error tracking into Atmos.

#### What This Means For You

**For Development Teams:**
- **See errors before they become incidents** - Get notified when errors occur in CI/CD pipelines
- **Understand error patterns** - See which errors are most common and prioritize fixes
- **Debug faster** - Full stack traces and context automatically captured
- **Track error trends** - Monitor error rates over time to catch regressions early

**For Platform Teams:**
- **Centralized error monitoring** - All Atmos errors across your organization in one place
- **Smart alerting** - Get notified about new errors or error spikes
- **Team collaboration** - Assign errors, track fixes, and document resolutions
- **Privacy-first** - Sensitive data is automatically filtered before sending to Sentry

**For Operations:**
- **Production visibility** - Know immediately when infrastructure operations fail
- **Historical analysis** - Review past errors to understand failure patterns
- **Correlation** - Link errors to specific deployments, components, or stacks
- **Zero configuration** - Works out of the box with your existing Sentry account

## How It Works

### Getting Started

Enable Sentry integration in your `atmos.yaml`:

```yaml
errors:
  sentry:
    enabled: true
    dsn: "https://your-sentry-dsn@sentry.io/project"
    environment: "production"  # or staging, development, etc.
    traces_sample_rate: 0.1    # Capture 10% for performance monitoring
```

That's it! Atmos will now automatically report errors to Sentry with full context.

### Privacy & Security

We take privacy seriously. The Sentry integration:

- **Filters sensitive data** automatically (secrets, tokens, API keys)
- **Requires explicit opt-in** - disabled by default
- **Respects your Sentry settings** - uses your organization's data scrubbing rules
- **Is fully configurable** - control what gets sent and what stays local

### Verbose Mode for Local Debugging

Need even more detail? Enable verbose error mode:

```bash
atmos terraform plan vpc -s prod --verbose
```

Verbose mode shows:
- Full stack traces
- Detailed error chains
- Internal debugging information
- Performance metrics

Perfect for troubleshooting complex issues locally, while keeping production logs clean.

## Better Errors = Better Experience

These improvements aren't just about error messagesâ€”they're about respecting your time and making Atmos a better tool to work with:

- **Faster debugging** - Find root causes in seconds, not hours
- **Reduced support burden** - Self-service troubleshooting with helpful hints
- **Proactive monitoring** - Catch problems before they impact users
- **Knowledge sharing** - Document error resolutions in Sentry for the whole team
- **Continuous improvement** - Use error analytics to prioritize bug fixes

## What's Next

This is just the beginning. We're continuing to improve error handling with:

- **More granular error types** for specific failure scenarios
- **Integration with other observability platforms** (DataDog, Honeycomb, etc.)
- **AI-powered error analysis** to suggest fixes automatically
- **Error recovery strategies** for common failure patterns

## Try It Today

These enhancements are available now in the latest version of Atmos. To get started:

1. **Update Atmos** to the latest version
2. **Configure Sentry** (optional but recommended) in your `atmos.yaml`
3. **Run any command** and see the improved error messages

We believe good error handling is a feature, not an afterthought. These improvements make Atmos more reliable, more debuggable, and more pleasant to use.
