We've improved the AWS SSO authentication experience by making verification codes more visible and adding an animated status indicator.

## What Changed

When authenticating with AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO), Atmos now displays the verification code in a styled dialog box with clear visual feedback during the authentication process.

### New Features

**1. Styled Verification Dialog**

The verification code is now displayed in a bordered dialog box with color-coded elements for better visibility:

```
╭───────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  🔐 AWS SSO Authentication Required          │
│                                               │
│  Verification Code:  WDDD-HRQV               │
│                                               │
│  https://company.awsapps.com/start/#/device  │
│                                               │
│  Opening browser... If it doesn't open,      │
│  visit the URL above.                        │
╰───────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

**2. Animated Spinner**

While waiting for authentication, an animated spinner shows real-time status with success/failure feedback.

**3. Graceful Degradation**

The enhancement automatically adapts to your environment:
- **Terminal environments**: Beautiful styled dialog with colors and animations
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Simple text output optimized for logs
- **Non-TTY environments**: Plain text fallback

## Why This Matters

Previously, the verification code was not displayed in the terminal at all. Now you can:

- **See the verification code directly in your terminal** without having to find it in the browser
- **Quickly locate the code** when switching between browser and terminal
- **Verify the code matches** what AWS displays in the browser
- **Monitor authentication progress** with real-time feedback

## Important Note

The verification code displayed is a **device authorization user code** (e.g., "WDDD-HRQV") generated by AWS for the OAuth 2.0 device flow—**this is NOT an MFA token**.

Any MFA prompts (such as authenticator app codes or SMS codes) will appear in your browser during the authentication flow, not in the terminal.

This enhancement makes AWS SSO authentication more user-friendly while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing workflows.
