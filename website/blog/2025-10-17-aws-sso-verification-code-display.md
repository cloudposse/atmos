We've significantly improved the AWS SSO authentication experience with styled verification code dialogs, animated status indicators, and proper Ctrl+C handling.

<!--truncate-->

## What Changed

When authenticating with AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO), Atmos now displays the verification code in a styled dialog box with clear visual feedback during the authentication process.

### New Features

**1. Styled Verification Dialog**

The verification code is now displayed in a bordered dialog box with color-coded elements for better visibility:

```
╭───────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  🔐 AWS SSO Authentication Required          │
│                                               │
│  Verification Code:  WDDD-HRQV               │
│                                               │
│  https://company.awsapps.com/start/#/device  │
│                                               │
│  Opening browser... If it doesn't open,      │
│  visit the URL above.                        │
╰───────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

**2. Animated Spinner**

While waiting for authentication, an animated spinner shows real-time status with success/failure feedback:

```
⠋ Waiting for authentication...
```

**3. Proper Ctrl+C Handling**

Pressing Ctrl+C during authentication now properly cancels the entire authentication process:
- Immediately stops the polling goroutine
- Closes all channels cleanly
- Returns a clear "authentication cancelled" error
- No resource leaks or hanging processes

**4. Graceful Degradation**

The enhancement automatically adapts to your environment:
- **Terminal environments**: Beautiful styled dialog with colors and animations
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Simple text output optimized for logs
- **Non-TTY environments**: Plain text fallback

## Why This Matters

### Better User Experience

Previously, the verification code was not displayed in the terminal at all. Now you can:

- **See the verification code directly in your terminal** without having to find it in the browser
- **Quickly locate the code** when switching between browser and terminal
- **Verify the code matches** what AWS displays in the browser
- **Monitor authentication progress** with real-time feedback
- **Cancel authentication cleanly** with Ctrl+C without leaving background processes running

### Consistent Across All Commands

This enhancement applies to **all** Atmos authentication commands that trigger AWS SSO login:

- `atmos auth login` - Interactive authentication
- `atmos auth env` - Get credentials as environment variables
- `atmos auth exec` - Execute commands with authenticated credentials

Any command that requires AWS SSO authentication will now show the styled verification dialog.

## Important Note

The verification code displayed is a **device authorization user code** (e.g., "WDDD-HRQV") generated by AWS for the OAuth 2.0 device flow—**this is NOT an MFA token**.

Any MFA prompts (such as authenticator app codes or SMS codes) will appear in your browser during the authentication flow, not in the terminal.

## Technical Details

### Implementation

The enhancement uses the [Charm Bracelet](https://charm.sh/) ecosystem for beautiful terminal UIs:

- **Lipgloss** - Styling and layout for the verification dialog
- **Bubbletea** - Terminal UI framework for the interactive spinner
- **Bubbles** - Pre-built spinner component

The implementation includes:

- TTY detection to automatically choose between styled dialogs and plain text
- Context-based cancellation for clean shutdown on Ctrl+C
- Proper goroutine management to prevent resource leaks
- Full test coverage with unit tests for all code paths

### Test Coverage

We've added comprehensive tests covering:

- Styled dialog rendering with various inputs
- Plain text fallback for non-TTY environments
- Context cancellation behavior
- Spinner state management

This enhancement makes AWS SSO authentication more user-friendly while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing workflows.
