We're excited to announce two major improvements to Atmos authentication: **per-step authentication for workflows** and **authentication support for custom commands**. These features enable you to seamlessly use cloud credentials in your automation while maintaining security through file-based credential management.

## Background: File-Based Credential Security

Atmos uses a secure file-based credential approach to prevent credential exposure:

- **Credentials are written to temporary files** following the XDG Base Directory Specification (e.g., `~/.config/atmos/aws/{provider-name}/credentials`, `~/.config/atmos/aws/{provider-name}/config`)
- **Environment variables point to these files** (`AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE`, `AWS_CONFIG_FILE`, `AWS_PROFILE`)
- **Raw credentials are never exposed** in environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` are never set)
- **SDKs read credentials from files** using the standard credential chain
- **Provider-organized structure** - credentials are organized by provider under XDG config directories

This approach ensures that credentials are isolated and never serialized in logs, process listings, or other outputs.

## Bug Fix: Auth Shell Environment Variables

We fixed a regression in `atmos auth shell` where it wasn't setting the required environment variables for credential file resolution. Previously, when you ran:

```bash
atmos auth shell my-identity
```

The spawned shell didn't have `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE`, `AWS_CONFIG_FILE`, or `AWS_PROFILE` set, so AWS SDK commands couldn't find credentials even though authentication succeeded.

This is now fixed - `atmos auth shell` properly configures the environment with file-based credential paths.

## Feature 1: Authentication for Workflows

Workflows now support per-step authentication with the new `identity` field:

```yaml
workflows:
  deploy-multi-account:
    description: Deploy infrastructure across multiple AWS accounts
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to dev account
        command: terraform apply
        identity: dev-account

      - name: Deploy to staging account
        command: terraform apply
        identity: staging-account

      - name: Deploy to prod account
        command: terraform apply
        identity: prod-account
```

### Command-Line Override

You can also set a default identity for all steps using the `--identity` flag:

```bash
# Use dev-account for all steps that don't specify their own identity
atmos workflow deploy-multi-account --identity dev-account
```

**Precedence**: Step-level `identity` > `--identity` flag > no authentication

### Use Cases

- **Multi-account deployments**: Authenticate to different AWS accounts per step
- **Cross-cloud workflows**: Switch between AWS, GCP, and Azure credentials
- **Role assumption chains**: Use different identities that assume through other identities
- **Environment-specific automation**: Dev, staging, and production credentials in a single workflow

## Feature 2: Authentication for Custom Commands

Custom commands now support authentication with the `identity` field:

```yaml
commands:
  - name: deploy
    description: Deploy infrastructure with authentication
    identity: production-account
    steps:
      - terraform init
      - terraform plan
      - terraform apply
```

### Runtime Override with --identity Flag

All custom commands automatically get an `--identity` flag for runtime override:

```bash
# Override the configured identity at runtime
atmos deploy --identity staging-account
```

**Precedence**: `--identity` flag > configured `identity` > no authentication

### Shared Identity Across Steps

All steps in a custom command share the same identity - the command authenticates once and all steps execute with those credentials.

## Examples

### Workflow with Mixed Authentication

```yaml
workflows:
  multi-cloud-deploy:
    description: Deploy across AWS and GCP
    steps:
      # AWS deployment
      - name: Deploy AWS infrastructure
        command: terraform apply -target=module.aws
        identity: aws-production

      # GCP deployment
      - name: Deploy GCP infrastructure
        command: terraform apply -target=module.gcp
        identity: gcp-production

      # No authentication needed
      - name: Update documentation
        command: ./scripts/update-docs.sh
```

### Custom Command with Component Config

```yaml
commands:
  - name: plan-all
    description: Plan all components in a stack
    identity: developer
    component_config:
      component: "{{ .Arguments.component }}"
      stack: "{{ .Arguments.stack }}"
    steps:
      - atmos terraform plan {{ .ComponentConfig.Component }} -s {{ .ComponentConfig.Stack }}
```

Run with override:

```bash
# Use production credentials instead of developer
atmos plan-all vpc prod --identity production
```

- [Custom Command Authentication](/cli/configuration/commands#using-authentication-with-custom-commands)
- [Auth Commands](/cli/commands/auth/usage)

## Try It Out

Update to the latest version of Atmos and try the new authentication features:

```bash
# Authenticate to an identity
atmos auth login my-identity

# Use in workflows
atmos workflow deploy --identity my-identity

# Use in custom commands
atmos my-command --identity my-identity

# Use auth shell (now with proper environment variables!)
atmos auth shell my-identity
```

We're excited to see how you use these features to simplify your multi-account and multi-cloud automation!
