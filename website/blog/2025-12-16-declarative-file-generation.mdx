Atmos now supports declarative file generation for Terraform components via the new `generate` section in stack configuration.

<!--truncate-->

## What Changed

A new `generate` section can be defined at the component level to declaratively specify files that should be generated alongside your Terraform components. This extends Atmos's existing pattern of generating backend configuration files to support arbitrary auxiliary files.

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    vpc:
      vars:
        environment: prod
      generate:
        # Map values are serialized based on file extension
        locals.tf:
          locals:
            environment: "{{ .vars.environment }}"

        # String values are treated as Go templates
        README.md: |
          # VPC Component
          Environment: {{ .vars.environment }}
```

### Key Features

- **Extension-aware serialization**: `.json`, `.yaml`, `.yml` files are serialized in their respective formats; `.tf` and `.hcl` files generate valid HCL
- **Go template support**: String values are processed as Go templates with full access to component context
- **Inheritance**: The `generate` section inherits from base components, following the same merge semantics as `vars`, `settings`, and other sections
- **CLI integration**: New `atmos terraform generate files` command with `--all`, `--dry-run`, and `--clean` flags
- **Auto-generation**: Enable `auto_generate_files: true` in `atmos.yaml` to automatically generate files during terraform commands
- **Clean integration**: Generated files are automatically cleaned up by `atmos terraform clean`

## Why This Matters

Teams often need to generate auxiliary configuration files that accompany their Terraform components—files like `.tool-versions`, `terragrunt.hcl` shims for gradual migration, or environment-specific locals. Previously, this required external tooling or manual maintenance.

The `generate` section brings this capability directly into Atmos's declarative configuration model, maintaining the principle that your infrastructure configuration should be fully described in YAML and reproducible from stack manifests.

## How to Use It

### Single Component

```bash
atmos terraform generate files vpc -s prod-ue2
```

### All Components

```bash
atmos terraform generate files --all
```

### Preview Changes

```bash
atmos terraform generate files --all --dry-run
```

### Clean Generated Files

```bash
atmos terraform generate files --all --clean
```

### Automatic Generation

Add to `atmos.yaml`:

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    auto_generate_files: true
```
