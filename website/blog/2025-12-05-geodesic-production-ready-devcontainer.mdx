While Atmos supports any devcontainer configuration, **Geodesic is a proven DevOps toolbox** that's been battle-tested for almost 10 years. If you're looking for a production-ready development container with all the tools you need for infrastructure work, Geodesic is your answer.

<!--truncate-->

## What is Geodesic?

[Geodesic](https://github.com/cloudposse/geodesic) is Cloud Posse's implementation of the DevOps toolbox pattern—a comprehensive development container that includes everything you need for modern infrastructure work.

**Geodesic is a devcontainer implementation.** It predates the Development Containers specification, but it's the exact same concept: a containerized environment with all your tools pre-installed and pre-configured.

## The DevOps Toolbox Pattern

The concept of containerized development environments—what we call "DevOps toolboxes"—originated in the DevOps world long before the Development Containers spec existed. Companies like CoreOS pioneered the toolbox pattern, recognizing that DevOps teams needed consistent, reproducible environments without installing dozens of tools locally.

The idea is simple but powerful: **package all your tools into a container, and developers just need Docker and a shell**.

Geodesic has been implementing this pattern since 2016, providing infrastructure teams with a battle-tested solution for the "works on my machine" problem.

## What's Included?

Geodesic comes pre-loaded with everything you need for infrastructure work:

### Core Infrastructure Tools
- **Atmos** (of course!)
- **Terraform** with all major providers
- **kubectl** and Kubernetes tools (helm, helmfile, k9s, etc.)
- **Cloud CLIs**: AWS CLI, Azure CLI, Google Cloud SDK
- **Data processing**: jq, yq, gomplate
- **Development essentials**: git, make, vim, and more
- **Custom scripts and tooling**

### Production-Tested Foundation

Geodesic images are:
- **Multi-platform**: linux/amd64 and linux/arm64
- **Debian-based**: Familiar package management
- **Customizable**: Use as a base image for your own toolbox
- **Production-tested**: Nearly a decade of real-world usage
- **Open source**: Over 1,000 stars on GitHub

## Using Geodesic with Atmos

With [Atmos's native devcontainer support](/changelog/native-devcontainer-support), using Geodesic is incredibly simple:

```yaml
# atmos.yaml
components:
  devcontainer:
    geodesic:
      spec:
        name: "Geodesic DevOps Toolbox"
        image: "cloudposse/geodesic:latest"
        workspaceFolder: "/workspace"
        workspaceMount: "type=bind,source=${PWD},target=/workspace"
        containerEnv:
          ATMOS_BASE_PATH: "/workspace"
        remoteUser: "root"
```

Then launch it:

```bash
atmos devcontainer shell geodesic
# You're in a fully-equipped DevOps environment
```

## Getting Started in 2 Minutes

Here's how fast you can go from zero to productive:

```bash
# 1. Install Atmos (one binary)
brew install atmos

# 2. Navigate to your infrastructure repo
cd my-infrastructure

# 3. Launch Geodesic
atmos devcontainer shell geodesic

# You're in. Start working.
$ atmos terraform plan vpc -s prod
$ kubectl get pods
$ helm list
```

**That's the ingenious part**: All you need to install is Atmos. Everything else—Terraform, cloud CLIs, Kubernetes tools—gets pulled from the container image automatically.

Your host machine stays clean. Your environment stays consistent. Your team uses identical tool versions.

## Quick Start with Examples

Check out the live examples in the Atmos repository:

```bash
# Clone Atmos repo (or just browse examples on GitHub)
git clone https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos.git
cd atmos/examples/devcontainer

# The example includes a complete configuration
cat atmos.yaml
# Shows geodesic devcontainer configuration

# Launch it
atmos devcontainer shell geodesic
```

The `examples/devcontainer` folder contains:
- Complete `atmos.yaml` with Geodesic configuration
- Example `devcontainer.json` file
- Shell aliases for convenience
- Ready-to-use setup

**Use this as a starting point** for your own configuration. Copy it, customize it, make it yours.

## Shell Aliases for One-Word Access

Make it even easier with shell aliases in your `atmos.yaml`:

```yaml
# atmos.yaml
cli:
  aliases:
    shell: "devcontainer shell geodesic"
```

Now you can just type:

```bash
atmos shell
# Immediately launches Geodesic
```

This mirrors the classic Geodesic pattern where you'd type `./geodesic.sh` to launch your environment. Now it's even simpler: `atmos shell`.

## Customizing Geodesic

### Use as a Base Image

Create your own custom toolbox based on Geodesic:

```dockerfile
FROM cloudposse/geodesic:latest

# Add your organization's tools
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    your-custom-tool \
    another-tool

# Add custom scripts
COPY scripts/ /usr/local/bin/

# Configure environment
ENV CUSTOM_VAR=value
```

### Version Pinning for Consistency

Pin specific Geodesic versions per project:

```yaml
# project-a/atmos.yaml
components:
  devcontainer:
    toolbox:
      spec:
        image: "cloudposse/geodesic:4.3.0"  # Pinned version

# project-b/atmos.yaml
components:
  devcontainer:
    toolbox:
      spec:
        image: "cloudposse/geodesic:4.4.0"  # Different version
```

Each project gets the right tool versions automatically.

## Real-World Workflows

### Onboarding a New Team Member

**Old way:**
1. Install Homebrew
2. Install Docker
3. Install Terraform (with tfenv or version manager)
4. Install kubectl
5. Install AWS CLI
6. Configure AWS credentials
7. Install Helm
8. Install Helmfile
9. Install jq, yq, and other tools
10. Debug version conflicts
11. Maybe productive by end of day?

**New way with Geodesic:**
```bash
brew install atmos
cd team-infrastructure
atmos devcontainer shell geodesic
# Productive in 2 minutes
```

### Working on Multiple Projects

**Old way:**
- Project A uses one set of tool versions
- Project B uses different tool versions
- Use version managers (tfenv, etc.) to switch constantly
- Hope you remember to switch before running commands

**New way with Geodesic:**
Each project defines its Geodesic version in `atmos.yaml`, and you automatically get the right tools when you launch the devcontainer for that project.

## Integration with Atmos Auth

Geodesic works seamlessly with Atmos's identity injection feature:

```bash
# Launch Geodesic with AWS identity
atmos devcontainer shell geodesic --identity aws-prod

# Launch with GitHub identity
atmos devcontainer shell geodesic --identity github-main

# Works with ANY provider - Azure, GCP, custom providers
atmos devcontainer shell geodesic --identity azure-prod
```

Inside the container, cloud provider SDKs automatically use the authenticated identity. No manual credential configuration needed.

## Multiple Instances

Need multiple environments? Launch Geodesic with different instance names:

```bash
# Development instance
atmos devcontainer shell geodesic --instance dev

# Production instance
atmos devcontainer shell geodesic --instance prod

# Each team member can have their own
atmos devcontainer shell geodesic --instance alice
atmos devcontainer shell geodesic --instance bob
```

Each instance is an independent container with its own state, perfect for running multiple environments or isolating work.

## Why Choose Geodesic?
