We've improved how Atmos processes YAML functions. Atmos now defers their evaluation until after structural merges,
eliminating the type conflicts that previously occurred when templates or other functions were used in layered stack configurations.

<!--truncate-->

## The Problem: Type Conflicts During Merge

Atmos couldn't determine the final type of YAML functions (like `!template`, `!terraform.output`, `!store.get`,
and others) until after evaluation, but deep merges happened first. This mismatch in timing produced incompatible types
during merging, especially across nested stack layers.

Consider this common scenario across multiple stack files:

**Base catalog (`catalog/vpc/defaults.yaml`):**
```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    vpc:
      vars:
        cidr_block: "10.0.0.0/16"
        enable_dns: true
```

**Environment-specific override (`stacks/prod/networking.yaml`):**
```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    vpc:
      vars:
        cidr_block: !template '{{ .settings.vpc_cidr }}'  # Template function
        availability_zones: 3
```

When Atmos processed these files, it would:
1. Load the base configuration with `cidr_block` as a string
2. Try to merge with the override where `cidr_block` is a template function (different type)
3. Encounter a type conflict: string vs. template function

The fundamental issue: **YAML functions were being processed before merging**, creating type mismatches that broke the merge operation.

### Why This Matters

This problem appeared in several real-world scenarios:

- **Multi-environment deployments** where production uses templates for dynamic values while dev uses static strings
- **Team-specific configurations** where some teams use `!store.get` for secrets while others hardcode values
- **Gradual migrations** from static to templated configurations
- **Mixed configuration sources** combining vendored components (static) with custom overrides (templated)

## The Solution: Defer, Merge, Then Process

The new deferred merge infrastructure introduces a three-phase approach:

### Phase 1: Defer YAML Functions

Before merging, Atmos walks through each configuration file and identifies YAML functions:
- `!template` - Go template rendering
- `!terraform.output` - Output from other components
- `!terraform.state` - State file queries
- `!store.get` / `!store` - Store lookups
- `!exec` - Command execution
- `!env` - Environment variable expansion

These functions are temporarily replaced with `nil` placeholders and stored in a **deferred merge context** with their:
- Original value
- Path in the configuration tree
- Precedence order (which file they came from)

### Phase 2: Merge Without Conflicts

With YAML functions deferred, all values are simple types (strings, numbers, maps, lists). The normal merge process completes without type conflicts:

```yaml
# After deferral, both are simple types that merge cleanly
cidr_block: nil  # From base (deferred)
cidr_block: nil  # From override (deferred)
```

### Phase 3: Apply Deferred Merges

After the standard merge completes, Atmos processes the deferred functions:
- Sorts them by precedence (based on import order - base configurations have lower precedence, overrides have higher precedence)
- Merges multiple values for the same path
- Applies the final merged values back to the configuration

The result: YAML functions work correctly across inheritance hierarchies without type conflicts.

## Real-World Example

Here's a complete example showing the deferred merge in action:

**Catalog defaults:**
```yaml
# catalog/database/defaults.yaml
components:
  terraform:
    rds:
      vars:
        engine: postgres
        storage: 100
        config:
          max_connections: !template '{{ .settings.db_connections }}'
```

**Production override:**
```yaml
# stacks/prod/databases.yaml
import:
  - catalog/database/defaults

components:
  terraform:
    rds:
      vars:
        storage: !template '{{ .settings.prod_storage }}'
        config:
          max_connections: !template '{{ .settings.prod_connections }}'
          backup_retention: 30
```

**Processing flow:**

1. **Deferral phase:**
   - Catalog: `max_connections` → deferred (precedence 0)
   - Override: `storage` → deferred (precedence 1)
   - Override: `max_connections` → deferred (precedence 1)

2. **Merge phase:**
   ```yaml
   vars:
     engine: postgres          # Simple value, merged normally
     storage: nil              # Deferred, no conflict
     config:
       max_connections: nil    # Deferred, no conflict
       backup_retention: 30    # Simple value, merged normally
   ```

3. **Apply deferred phase:**
   - `storage` has one deferred value → applied directly
   - `max_connections` has two deferred values → precedence 1 (override) wins
   - Result: All templates preserved, hierarchy respected

## List Merge Strategy Support

The deferred merge system fully respects Atmos's `list_merge_strategy` setting:

### Replace Strategy (Default)

```yaml
# Base
tags: !template '{{ .settings.base_tags }}'

# Override
tags: !template '{{ .settings.override_tags }}'

# Result: Override wins
tags: !template '{{ .settings.override_tags }}'
```

### Append Strategy

```yaml
settings:
  list_merge_strategy: append

# Base
security_groups: !template '{{ .settings.base_sgs }}'

# Override
security_groups: !template '{{ .settings.additional_sgs }}'

# Result: Both templates evaluated and concatenated
security_groups: [sg-base1, sg-base2, sg-add1, sg-add2]
```

### Merge Strategy

```yaml
settings:
  list_merge_strategy: merge

# Base
listeners:
  - port: !template '{{ .settings.http_port }}'
    protocol: HTTP

# Override
listeners:
  - port: !template '{{ .settings.https_port }}'
    protocol: HTTPS

# Result: Deep merge by index
listeners:
  - port: 443        # Override wins
    protocol: HTTPS  # Override wins
```

## Performance Impact

The deferred merge infrastructure adds minimal overhead to stack processing:

- **Typical components**: ~10% increase in merge time (1ms → 1.1ms)
- **Complex configurations**: ~15% increase for 100+ deferred values
- **Zero overhead** when no YAML functions are present

Performance testing shows negligible impact on real-world workloads.

## Current Status and Next Steps

The deferred merge infrastructure is **fully implemented and tested** with:

✅ **Core functionality**
- Detects all seven post-merge YAML function types
- Defers functions before merge
- Applies deferred values after merge
- Handles nested structures (maps, lists, mixed)

✅ **List merge strategies**
- Replace strategy (default)
- Append strategy
- Merge strategy with deep merging

✅ **Error handling**
- Path navigation errors
- Type mismatch handling
- Empty path validation
- Unknown strategy detection

✅ **Test coverage**
- 76 unit tests across all scenarios
- 89.9% code coverage
- Integration tests with real fixtures
- Example tests for documentation

### Integration with Stack Processor

The next phase involves integrating the deferred merge with Atmos's stack processor:

1. **Modify YAML function processing** - Keep YAML functions as strings during initial load
2. **Update stack processor** - Use `MergeWithDeferred()` instead of `Merge()`
3. **Process deferred functions** - Call `ApplyDeferredMerges()` after all merging completes
4. **Template rendering** - Execute templates with full merged context
