Several terraform CLI flags that were not working after version 1.202.0 have been restored. These flags were inadvertently broken during the command registry migration.

<!--truncate-->

## The Problem

Starting in version 1.202.0, several terraform flags were not recognized or not functioning correctly:

```bash
# These flags were returning "unknown flag" errors or being ignored:
atmos terraform workspace mycomponent -s mystack --auto-generate-backend-file=false
atmos terraform output mycomponent -s mystack --skip-init
atmos terraform plan mycomponent -s mystack --deploy-run-init=false
```

This was problematic for CI/CD pipelines and workflows that relied on these flags for controlling Atmos behavior.

## Fixed Flags

The following flags are now properly registered and working:

| Flag                           | Description                                                 |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--skip-init`                  | Skip terraform init before running command                  |
| `--auto-generate-backend-file` | Override auto_generate_backend_file setting from atmos.yaml |
| `--deploy-run-init`            | Override deploy_run_init setting from atmos.yaml            |
| `--init-run-reconfigure`       | Override init_run_reconfigure setting from atmos.yaml       |
| `--planfile`                   | Path to a terraform plan file to use                        |
| `--skip-planfile`              | Skip writing the plan to a planfile                         |

## Example Usage

```bash
# Skip init for output commands (useful when already initialized)
atmos terraform output mycomponent -s mystack --skip-init

# Override backend file generation
atmos terraform workspace mycomponent -s mystack --auto-generate-backend-file=false

# Control init behavior during deploy
atmos terraform deploy mycomponent -s mystack --deploy-run-init=false
```

## Root Cause

During the terraform command registry migration in version 1.202.0, these flags were registered in the old parsing
code but not in the new flag registry. The flags needed to be explicitly registered in the shared terraform flag registry
so Cobra would recognize them.

## Upgrade

Upgrade Atmos to get this fix. No configuration changes are required.
