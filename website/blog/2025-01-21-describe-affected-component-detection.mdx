Atmos now correctly detects component file changes when running `atmos describe affected`.
A regression in previous Atmos releases caused changes to Terraform, Helmfile, or Packer component files to not be detected in certain scenarios.

<!--truncate-->

## The Problem

When using `atmos describe affected` to identify components impacted by code changes, the command was only detecting stack configuration changes but missing actual component file changes. For example, modifying a `main.tf` file inside a Terraform component folder would not mark that component as affected.

This issue occurred because git diff returns file paths relative to the git repository root, while the path resolution was using the current working directory. When Atmos was run from a subdirectory (e.g., using `atmos -C examples/demo-stacks`), these paths would not match, causing component changes to go undetected.

## The Fix

We updated the changed files indexing logic to properly resolve relative paths against the git repository root instead of the current working directory. The fix ensures that:

- Relative paths from git diff are correctly resolved against the git repo root
- Component folder changes are detected regardless of where Atmos is executed from
- Individual file changes within component directories are properly tracked

## Example

Now when you modify component files, `atmos describe affected` correctly identifies them:

```bash
# Modify a component file
echo "# comment" >> components/terraform/vpc/main.tf

# Run describe affected
atmos describe affected --ref refs/heads/main

# Output now includes the vpc component
[
  {
    "component": "vpc",
    "stack": "plat-ue2-dev",
    "affected": "component"
  }
]
```

## Usage

Upgrade to the latest version of Atmos and run:

```bash
atmos describe affected --ref refs/heads/main
```

The command now correctly detects:
- Changes to component folders (Terraform, Helmfile, Packer)
- Changes to individual files within components
- Stack configuration changes (as before)

This fix ensures your CI/CD pipelines accurately identify which components need to be deployed based on actual code changes.
