import Terminal from '@site/src/components/Terminal'

We've shipped a feature that developers working with complex infrastructure configurations have been asking for: **provenance tracking**. With the new `--provenance` flag in `atmos describe component`, you can now see exactly where every configuration value originated—down to the file, line number, and column.

## The Problem: Configuration Archaeology

If you've worked with Atmos's hierarchical stack configurations, you know the power of inheritance and deep merging. But that power comes with a challenge: when you see a configuration value, where did it actually come from?

Previously, if you saw an unexpected value like `cidr: "10.100.0.0/16"`, you'd have to:
- Mentally trace through import chains
- Open multiple YAML files
- Grep through your stack configurations
- Reconstruct the merge order in your head

The existing `sources` system showed top-level keys, but couldn't tell you about nested values, array elements, or map entries. And it didn't include line numbers—just file paths.

## The Solution: Line-Level Provenance

The new provenance tracking system records the exact source of **every value** in your component configuration. Not just top-level keys—every nested field, every array element, every map entry.

### Basic Usage

```bash
atmos describe component vpc -s prod-ue2 --provenance
```

This displays your component configuration with inline comments showing where each value originated:

<Terminal title="atmos describe component vpc -s prod-ue2 --provenance">
```yaml
# Provenance Legend:
#   ● [1] Defined in parent stack
#   ○ [N] Inherited/imported (N=2+ levels deep)
#   ∴ Computed/templated

import:                                           # ○ [2] orgs/acme/_defaults.yaml:2
  - catalog/vpc/defaults                          # ○ [2] orgs/acme/_defaults.yaml:2
  - mixins/region/us-east-2                       # ● [1] orgs/acme/prod/us-east-2.yaml:3
  - orgs/acme/_defaults                           # ○ [2] orgs/acme/prod/_defaults.yaml:2
vars:                                             # ○ [3] catalog/vpc/defaults.yaml:8
  cidr: "10.100.0.0/16"                           # ● [1] orgs/acme/prod/us-east-2.yaml:10
  name: vpc                                       # ○ [3] catalog/vpc/defaults.yaml:9
  region: us-east-2                               # ○ [2] mixins/region/us-east-2.yaml:2
  namespace: acme                                 # ○ [3] orgs/acme/_defaults.yaml:2
```
</Terminal>

### Understanding the Symbols

Provenance uses three symbols to show how values were defined:

- **● (black circle)** - Defined in the parent stack `[1]`
- **○ (white circle)** - Inherited/imported `[N]` where N indicates depth in the import chain
- **∴ (therefore)** - Computed/templated value

The depth indicator `[N]` tells you how many levels deep in the import chain a value came from:
- `[1]` - Defined directly in the stack you're describing
- `[2]` - Inherited from a first-level import
- `[3+]` - Inherited from deeper in the import chain

When displayed on a TTY, the depth indicators are color-coded:
- Cyan for depth 1 (parent stack)
- Green for depth 2 (first import)
- Orange for depth 3 (second import)
- Red for depth 4+ (deeper imports)

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. Debugging Unexpected Values

```bash
$ atmos describe component vpc -s prod-ue2 --provenance | grep cidr

  cidr: "10.100.0.0/16"  # ● [1] orgs/acme/prod/us-east-2.yaml:10
```

Instantly see that the CIDR is defined in the parent stack at line 10. No more guessing.

### 2. Understanding Inheritance Chains

For complex configurations with multiple inheritance levels, provenance shows the complete picture. Use `grep` to find specific values:

```bash
$ atmos describe component app -s staging-uw2 --provenance | grep replicas

  replicas: 3  # ○ [2] catalog/app/defaults.yaml:15
```

You can see that `replicas` is inherited from a catalog default at depth 2.

### 3. Auditing Security Settings

For compliance and security audits, verify where sensitive configurations originated:

```bash
$ atmos describe component bastion -s prod-ue2 --provenance | grep -A5 security

security:                                         # ○ [2] catalog/bastion/defaults.yaml:20
  allowed_cidr_blocks:                            # ● [1] stacks/prod/security.yaml:8
    - "10.0.0.0/8"                                # ● [1] stacks/prod/security.yaml:9
    - "172.16.0.0/12"                             # ● [1] stacks/prod/security.yaml:10
```

Confirm all security settings come from approved configuration files.

### 4. Pipe-able Output for Automation

The YAML output with provenance is still valid YAML, so it works with standard tools:

```bash
$ atmos describe component vpc -s prod-ue2 --provenance | yq '.vars.cidr'
10.100.0.0/16
```

Comments are preserved for human review while the data remains machine-parseable.

:::note
The `--query` flag is not supported with `--provenance`. To filter provenance output, pipe it through tools like `grep`, `yq`, or `jq`.

## Terminal vs Non-Terminal Output

Provenance adapts to your environment:

**On TTY (interactive terminal):**
- Two-column side-by-side layout (Configuration │ Provenance)
- Color-coded depth indicators
- Syntax highlighting
- Visual symbols

**Non-TTY (pipes, CI/CD):**
- Single-column layout (preserves valid YAML)
- Inline comments without color codes
- Plain text symbols
- Optimized for scripting

## How It Works

Provenance tracking follows your configuration through its entire journey:

As Atmos processes your stacks, it reads each YAML file and tracks every value it encounters. When it reads a line like `cidr: "10.100.0.0/16"` from `orgs/acme/prod/us-east-2.yaml`, it records: "I saw this value at line 10, column 3 in this file."

When Atmos imports another file, it remembers where it came from and how deep in the import chain it is. If `_defaults.yaml` imports `mixins/region.yaml`, and that defines `region: us-east-2`, Atmos tracks that this value came from two levels deep in the import chain.

As configurations merge together—when a child stack overrides a parent's value, or when imports stack on top of each other—Atmos remembers each step. It knows which file provided the final value, but also which files were overridden along the way.

Finally, when you run `atmos describe component --provenance`, it annotates the output with all this information: which file, which line, how deep in the import chain, and whether the value was defined directly, inherited, or computed from a template.

Performance overhead is minimal—less than 10% when provenance tracking is enabled, and zero overhead when disabled (the default).

## Get Started

Provenance tracking is available now in Atmos. To try it:

```bash
# View provenance for any component
atmos describe component <component> -s <stack> --provenance

# Save to file
atmos describe component vpc -s prod --provenance --file vpc-config.yaml

# Find specific values with grep
atmos describe component vpc -s prod --provenance | grep cidr

# JSON format
atmos describe component vpc -s prod --provenance --format json
```

For complete documentation, see [atmos describe component](/cli/commands/describe/component).

## Future Enhancements

The provenance system is built on an extensible interface that will enable:
- **atmos.yaml provenance** - Track where Atmos configuration settings come from
- **Vendor provenance** - Show origins of vendored components
- **Workflow provenance** - Track workflow step origins
- **IDE integration** - Hover-to-see-provenance in editors
- **Diff mode** - Show provenance changes between versions

We'd love to hear how you're using provenance tracking. Share your use cases in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/discussions) or open an issue if you find any bugs.
