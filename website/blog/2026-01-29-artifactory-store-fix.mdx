Fixed Artifactory store retrieval issues and corrected store documentation to accurately reflect supported backends.

<!--truncate-->

## What Changed

The Artifactory store's `GetKey` method was missing configuration required by the JFrog SDK for proper file downloads. Additionally, store documentation across multiple pages contained outdated examples with unsupported backends and incorrect field names.

### Code Fix

The `GetKey` method now includes the same JFrog SDK configuration (`Flat=true` and trailing path separator handling) that the `Get` method uses, ensuring consistent behavior for all retrieval operations.

### Documentation Corrections

- **Field names**: Changed `backend` to `type` and `config` to `options` to match the actual schema
- **Store types**: Updated `aws/ssm` to `aws-ssm-parameter-store`
- **Removed unsupported backends**: Vault and AWS Secrets Manager examples were removed (not implemented)
- **Added supported backends**: Azure Key Vault and Google Secret Manager now documented
- **Artifactory guidance**: Added note about using Generic repository type

### Test Coverage

Added comprehensive integration tests for the Artifactory store with a mock HTTP server that validates the JFrog SDK integration patterns including AQL search, checksum validation, and file path handling.

## Why This Matters

Users configuring external stores can now rely on accurate documentation. The Artifactory store now works correctly for both `Get` and `GetKey` operations.
