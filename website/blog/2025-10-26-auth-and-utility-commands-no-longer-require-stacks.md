Atmos auth, documentation, and workflow management commands now work independently of stack configurations, making it easier to use Atmos in CI/CD pipelines and alongside "native" Terraform workflows.

<!--truncate-->

## What Changed

Six Atmos commands that don't operate on stacks have been updated to no longer require stack configurations:

**Auth Commands:**
- `atmos auth env` - Export cloud credentials as environment variables
- `atmos auth exec` - Execute commands with authenticated credentials
- `atmos auth shell` - Launch an authenticated shell session

**Utility Commands:**
- `atmos list workflows` - List available workflows
- `atmos list vendor` - List vendor configurations
- `atmos docs <component>` - Display component documentation

## Why This Matters

Previously, these commands would fail with an error if you didn't have `stacks.base_path` and `stacks.included_paths` configured in your `atmos.yaml`:

```
Error: failed to initialize atmos config
stack base path must be provided in 'stacks.base_path' config or ATMOS_STACKS_BASE_PATH' ENV variable
```

This created an unnecessary barrier for teams who wanted to:

- Use Atmos auth for credential management without adopting full stack-based configuration
- Run authentication commands in CI/CD pipelines
- Browse component documentation without setting up stacks
- Manage workflows independently of stack operations

## Better Support for "Native" Terraform

Everyone says they're using "native" Terraform, but as we point out in [Nobody Runs Native Terraform](https://cloudposse.com/blog/nobody-runs-native-terraform/), teams are actually using wrapper scripts, CI/CD templating, shared modules, and various abstractions around Terraformâ€”they're just not using a dedicated framework. Atmos is designed to work alongside your existing workflow, not force you into a specific pattern.

With this change, you can now use Atmos components incrementally:

### Just Authentication
Use Atmos for cloud credential management without any stack configuration:

```yaml
# atmos.yaml - minimal config for auth only
base_path: .

auth:
  providers:
    aws-prod:
      kind: aws-sso
      type: aws
      region: us-east-1
      sso_start_url: https://mycompany.awsapps.com/start
      sso_region: us-east-1
      sso_account_id: "123456789012"
      sso_role_name: AdministratorAccess

  identities:
    prod-admin:
      provider: aws-prod
      default: true
```

Then use it with your existing Terraform:

```bash
# Get authenticated credentials
atmos auth exec -- terraform plan

# Or export credentials for your scripts
eval $(atmos auth env)
```

### Just Vendor Management
Use Atmos to vendor and manage component dependencies without adopting stack-based configuration:

```bash
# List all vendored components
atmos list vendor

# Pull component updates
atmos vendor pull
```

### Just Documentation
Browse component README files without any stack configuration:

```bash
# View component documentation
atmos docs vpc
atmos docs eks-cluster
```

### Incremental Adoption
Start with authentication and vendor management, then gradually adopt stack-based configuration as your needs evolve. Each Atmos feature can be used independently.

## What Hasn't Changed

Commands that actually work with stacks still require stack configuration:

- `atmos list stacks`
- `atmos list components`
- `atmos describe component`
- `atmos terraform plan/apply`

This ensures that stack-dependent operations have the context they need while allowing utility commands to work independently.

## CI/CD Benefits

This change is particularly valuable for CI/CD pipelines where you might want to:

**Authenticate without stack context:**
```bash
# In your CI pipeline
atmos auth exec -- aws sts get-caller-identity
atmos auth exec -- terraform init
atmos auth exec -- terraform plan
```

**Manage vendor dependencies:**
```bash
# Check for outdated components
atmos list vendor --format json
```

**Execute workflows:**
```bash
# Run deployment workflows
atmos workflow deploy -f workflows/deploy.yaml
```

## Migration Guide

No migration needed! This is a purely additive enhancement. If your commands were working before, they'll continue to work exactly the same way.

If you were previously blocked by stack configuration requirements, you can now:

1. Remove unnecessary stack configuration from your `atmos.yaml` if you're only using auth/vendor/docs commands
2. Start using Atmos incrementally without committing to full stack-based configuration
3. Use Atmos auth in environments where stacks don't make sense (like shared service accounts or CI runners)

## Technical Details

The fix involved changing these commands to skip stack manifest processing during initialization. Stack paths and configurations are still respected when present, but they're no longer required for commands that don't need them.

This enhancement makes Atmos more flexible and easier to adopt incrementally, letting you choose which features add value to your workflow without requiring all-or-nothing adoption.
