`atmos auth logout` now preserves keychain credentials by default for faster re-authentication. Only session data is cleared. Use `--keychain` to permanently delete credentials.

## What Changed

**Before:** `atmos auth logout` deleted everything (keychain credentials + session data)
**After:** `atmos auth logout` only clears session data, preserves keychain credentials

This means you don't have to re-enter access keys every time you log back in.

## Why This Matters

Most logouts are temporary (end of day, switching identities), not permanent credential removal. Forcing credential re-entry every time encourages users to skip logout entirely.

Now logout is fast and reversible:

```shell
# End of day
$ atmos auth logout dev-admin
✓ Cleared session data
✓ Preserved keychain credentials

# Next morning - instant re-authentication
$ atmos auth login dev-admin
✓ Authenticated as dev-admin
```

## Permanently Delete Credentials

Use `--keychain` when you need to remove credentials permanently:

```shell
atmos auth logout dev-admin --keychain
```

Interactive confirmation prevents accidents. Use `--force` for CI/CD:

```shell
atmos auth logout dev-admin --keychain --force
```

## Migration

If your scripts expect the old behavior (delete everything), add `--keychain`:

```shell
atmos auth logout dev-admin --keychain --force
```

For most users, no changes needed.
