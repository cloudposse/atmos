The source provisioner now provides better visual feedback with spinners during auto-provisioning and interactive confirmation prompts for delete operations.

<!--truncate-->

## What Changed

Three UX improvements to the source provisioner:

1. **Auto-provisioning spinner**: When components are automatically vendored on first use, you now see a spinner with progress instead of static messages
2. **Interactive delete confirmation**: Running `atmos terraform source delete` without `--force` now prompts for confirmation instead of erroring
3. **Delete operation spinner**: Deletion shows a spinner during the operation for consistent feedback

## Why This Matters

These changes align the source provisioner with UX patterns used elsewhere in Atmos:

```shell
# Before: Static messages during auto-provisioning
ℹ Auto-provisioning source for component 'myapp'
✓ Auto-provisioned source to .workdir/terraform/dev-myapp

# After: Spinner shows progress
⠋ Auto-provisioning source for 'myapp'
✓ Auto-provisioned source to .workdir/terraform/dev-myapp
```

```shell
# Before: Delete required --force or failed
$ atmos terraform source delete myapp --stack dev
Error: --force flag required for safety

# After: Interactive confirmation when --force omitted
$ atmos terraform source delete myapp --stack dev
? Delete directory: .workdir/terraform/dev-myapp? [Yes!/No.]
⠋ Deleting .workdir/terraform/dev-myapp
✓ Deleted .workdir/terraform/dev-myapp
```

## How to Use It

No configuration changes needed. The improvements apply automatically:

- **With TTY**: Get interactive prompts and spinners
- **Without TTY (CI/scripts)**: Use `--force` to skip confirmation, spinners degrade gracefully
- **Force flag**: Still available for scripted workflows: `atmos terraform source delete myapp --stack dev --force`
