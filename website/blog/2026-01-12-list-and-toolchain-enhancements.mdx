New query syntax for `atmos list components` and support for installing multiple tools at once with `atmos toolchain install`.

<!--truncate-->

## What Changed

### Simplified Query Syntax for List Commands

The `atmos list components` command now supports a simplified query syntax that makes filtering components more intuitive:

```bash
# Filter by stack pattern
atmos list components plat-ue2-dev

# Filter by component name
atmos list components vpc

# Combine filters
atmos list components vpc plat-ue2-dev
```

This replaces the need for verbose `--stack` flags in many common cases.

### New `atmos list aliases` Subcommand

View all configured CLI command aliases in your `atmos.yaml`:

```bash
atmos list aliases
```

This helps you discover shortcuts configured in your project.

### Multi-Tool Installation

Install multiple tools in a single command:

```bash
atmos toolchain install opentofu tflint kubectl helm
```

Previously, each tool required a separate `atmos toolchain install` invocation. Now you can batch installations with a progress summary.

## Why This Matters

- **Faster Workflows**: Query syntax reduces typing for common list operations
- **Better Discoverability**: The aliases command helps teams discover configured shortcuts
- **Streamlined Setup**: Multi-tool installation speeds up environment bootstrapping

## How to Use It

Update to the latest version of Atmos:

```bash
atmos version install latest
```

Then try the new features:

```bash
# Explore the simplified query syntax
atmos list components --help

# View your configured aliases
atmos list aliases

# Install your toolchain in one command
atmos toolchain install opentofu terraform-docs tflint
```
