## Working Directory for Commands and Workflows

Custom commands and workflow steps can now specify a `working_directory` to control where they execute:

```yaml
# .atmos.d/commands.yaml
commands:
  - name: localstack
    description: Start LocalStack for local development
    working_directory: docker/localstack
    steps:
      - docker compose up -d
```

```yaml
# stacks/workflows/deploy.yaml
workflows:
  build-and-deploy:
    steps:
      - command: make build
        working_directory: !repo-root
        type: shell
      - command: docker compose up -d
        working_directory: docker/app
        type: shell
```

- **Absolute paths** are used as-is
- **Relative paths** resolve against `base_path`
- **Step-level** overrides workflow-level settings
