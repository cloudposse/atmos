## Working Directory for Commands and Workflows

Custom commands and workflow steps can now specify a `working_directory` to control where they execute:

```yaml
# .atmos.d/commands.yaml
commands:
  - name: build
    working_directory: !repo-root .
    steps:
      - make build
```

```yaml
# stacks/workflows/deploy.yaml
workflows:
  download-tools:
    working_directory: /tmp
    steps:
      - command: wget https://example.com/tools.tar.gz
        type: shell
      - command: tar -xzf tools.tar.gz
        type: shell
```

- **Absolute paths** are used as-is
- **Relative paths** resolve against `base_path`
- **Step-level** overrides workflow-level settings
