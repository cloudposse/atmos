The `vendor pull` command now supports a `--stack` flag to vendor all components defined in a specific stack at once.

<!--truncate-->

## What Changed

The `atmos vendor pull` command now accepts a `--stack` flag that vendors all components with vendor configurations in the specified stack. This eliminates the need to vendor components individually when working with a specific stack.

```shell
# Vendor all components in a stack
atmos vendor pull --stack plat-ue2-dev

# Combine with dry-run to preview
atmos vendor pull --stack plat-ue2-dev --dry-run
```

## Why This Matters

Previously, vendoring components required either:
- Running `vendor pull --component <name>` for each component individually
- Using `vendor pull --everything` to vendor all components globally

The new `--stack` flag provides a middle ground, allowing you to vendor only the components relevant to a specific stack deployment.

## How to Use It

Simply add the `--stack` flag with your stack name:

```shell
# Vendor components for production stack
atmos vendor pull --stack prod-us-east-1

# Preview what would be vendored
atmos vendor pull --stack staging-eu-west-1 --dry-run
```

The command will identify all components in the stack that have vendor configurations (via `component.yaml`) and vendor them together.
