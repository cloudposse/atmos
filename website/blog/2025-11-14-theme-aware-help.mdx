Atmos help text now automatically adapts to your configured theme, providing a consistent and visually cohesive experience across all commands. Whether you're using a dark theme like Dracula or a light theme like GitHub, help output will match your terminal's color scheme.

## What Changed

Previously, help text used a fixed color scheme that didn't respect your terminal theme settings. Now, when you run any `--help` command, the output automatically uses colors from your configured theme.

## How It Works

The theme system applies to all help output:

```bash
# Help text uses your configured theme
atmos terraform plan --help
atmos describe stacks --help
atmos --help
```

If you have a theme configured in `atmos.yaml` or via the `ATMOS_THEME` environment variable, all help text will automatically use those colors for syntax highlighting, headings, and examples.

## Force Color Output

For screenshot generation or CI/CD environments, you can force colored output even when not connected to a TTY:

```bash
# Force color output for screenshots
atmos --help --force-color

# Or use environment variable
ATMOS_FORCE_COLOR=true atmos terraform plan --help
```

This ensures consistent, colorful output regardless of the execution environment.

## Configuration

Set your theme in `atmos.yaml`:

```yaml
settings:
  terminal:
    theme: dracula
```

Or use an environment variable:

```bash
export ATMOS_THEME=solarized-dark
```
