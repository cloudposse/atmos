Atmos now has built-in CI integration that generates rich, tfcmt-style job summaries directly from `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`. No additional GitHub Actions required—just add `--ci` to your commands.

<!--truncate-->

## Why This Matters

Previously, getting beautiful plan summaries in GitHub Actions required using separate actions like `github-action-atmos-terraform-plan` and `github-action-atmos-terraform-apply`. These worked well but added complexity to your workflows.

Now, Atmos handles everything natively. The same rich output you're used to—resource badges, collapsible diffs, terraform outputs—is generated directly by Atmos when running in CI mode.

## Enabling CI Mode

CI mode activates when any of these conditions are met:

1. **Config setting**: `ci.enabled: true` in `atmos.yaml`
2. **Environment detection**: Running in GitHub Actions (`GITHUB_ACTIONS=true`) or other CI environments (`CI=true`)
3. **Explicit flag**: Using `--ci` on the command line

```bash
# Auto-detected in GitHub Actions
atmos terraform plan mycomponent -s dev-us-east-1

# Force CI mode anywhere
atmos terraform plan mycomponent -s dev-us-east-1 --ci
```

You can also enable it via environment variable:

```bash
export CI=true
atmos terraform plan mycomponent -s dev-us-east-1
```

## Simple GitHub Actions Workflow

Here's a minimal workflow that generates rich plan summaries:

```yaml
name: Terraform Plan

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  plan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Atmos
        uses: cloudposse/github-action-setup-atmos@v2

      - name: Terraform Plan
        run: atmos terraform plan mycomponent -s dev-us-east-1
        env:
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
```

That's it. Atmos detects GitHub Actions automatically and writes the plan summary to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`.

## What You Get

The job summary includes:

- **Status badges** - CREATE, CHANGE, REPLACE, DESTROY indicators at a glance
- **Resource lists** - Collapsible sections showing exactly what will change
- **Destroy warnings** - Prominent caution callouts when resources will be deleted
- **Terraform outputs** - Table of output values after apply
- **Reproduction command** - Easy copy-paste to run locally

Example plan summary:

```
## Changes Found for `vpc` in `dev-us-east-1`

[![destroy](https://shields.io/badge/PLAN-DESTROY-critical?style=for-the-badge)](#)

> [!CAUTION]
> **Terraform will delete resources!**

<details><summary>Plan: 3 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy</summary>

### Create
+ aws_vpc.main
+ aws_subnet.public[0]
+ aws_subnet.public[1]

### Destroy
- aws_security_group.deprecated

</details>
```

## Apply Workflow

For apply, the workflow is just as simple:

```yaml
name: Terraform Apply

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  apply:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Atmos
        uses: cloudposse/github-action-setup-atmos@v2

      - name: Terraform Apply
        run: atmos terraform apply mycomponent -s dev-us-east-1 -auto-approve
        env:
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
```

## Matrix Strategy for Multiple Components

Plan multiple components in parallel:

```yaml
jobs:
  plan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        include:
          - component: vpc
            stack: dev-us-east-1
          - component: eks
            stack: dev-us-east-1
          - component: rds
            stack: dev-us-east-1
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: cloudposse/github-action-setup-atmos@v2
      - run: atmos terraform plan ${{ matrix.component }} -s ${{ matrix.stack }}
```

Each job gets its own summary section in the GitHub Actions UI.

## Local Testing

Test CI output locally by setting environment variables:

```bash
# Write summary to a file
export ATMOS_CI_SUMMARY=/tmp/summary.md
atmos terraform plan mycomponent -s dev --ci
cat /tmp/summary.md

# Or just view in terminal (writes to stderr)
atmos terraform plan mycomponent -s dev --ci
```

## Configuration

Enable CI integration globally in `atmos.yaml`:

```yaml
ci:
  enabled: true  # Explicitly enable CI mode
```

When `ci.enabled: true` is set, Atmos will generate rich summaries and write to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` automatically—even without the `--ci` flag.

The precedence order is:
1. `--ci` flag (highest priority)
2. `CI` or `GITHUB_ACTIONS` environment variables
3. `ci.enabled` in `atmos.yaml`

## Get Started

Native CI integration is available now. Simply upgrade Atmos and start using `--ci` or let it auto-detect your CI environment.

For more details, see the [`atmos terraform plan`](/cli/commands/terraform/plan) and [`atmos terraform apply`](/cli/commands/terraform/apply) command documentation.
