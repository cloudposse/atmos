If you develop Terraform providers, you can now test them locally with Atmos-managed components using Terraform's development overrides feature. This enables rapid iteration without publishing development versions to a registry.

<!--truncate-->

## Overview

When developing Terraform providers, you need to test them with real infrastructure code. Terraform's development overrides let you point to locally-built provider binaries instead of downloading from a registry. This works with Atmos components.

## How It Works

Development overrides use two separate mechanisms that work together:

### 1. Provider Binary Location (Terraform CLI Config)

Create a `.terraformrc` file in your component directory:

```hcl
provider_installation {
  dev_overrides {
    "registry.terraform.io/myorg/myprovider" = "/absolute/path/to/provider/bin"
  }
  direct {}
}
```

This tells Terraform where to find your locally-built provider binary instead of downloading it from a registry.

### 2. Provider Configuration (Atmos Stack Manifests)

Configure provider behavior using the `providers` section in your stack manifests as usual:

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    myapp:
      providers:
        myprovider:
          endpoint: "https://api.example.com"
          api_token: "{{ .settings.api_token }}"

      env:
        TF_CLI_CONFIG_FILE: ".terraformrc"
```

Atmos continues to generate `providers_override.tf.json` for provider configuration, while Terraform uses your local binary via `dev_overrides`.

## Setup

**1. Create `.terraformrc` in your component directory**

Place the file in your component folder (e.g., `components/terraform/myapp/.terraformrc`):

```hcl
provider_installation {
  dev_overrides {
    "registry.terraform.io/myorg/myprovider" = "/absolute/path/to/provider/bin"
  }
  direct {}
}
```

Atmos executes Terraform from the component directory, so the file must be there.

**2. Configure the environment variable**

In your stack manifest:

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    myapp:
      env:
        TF_CLI_CONFIG_FILE: ".terraformrc"
```

**3. Build and test your provider**

```bash
# Build provider
cd providers/terraform-provider-myprovider
go build -o bin/terraform-provider-myprovider

# Test with Atmos
cd ../../
atmos terraform plan myapp -s dev
```

Terraform uses your local binary. Atmos handles configuration.

## Workflow

```bash
# Edit provider code
vim providers/terraform-provider-myprovider/provider.go

# Rebuild
cd providers/terraform-provider-myprovider
go build -o bin/terraform-provider-myprovider

# Test with Atmos
cd ../../
atmos terraform plan myapp -s dev
```

Changes are available immediately without publishing.

## Key Points

**File location**: The `.terraformrc` file goes in the component directory (e.g., `components/terraform/myapp/.terraformrc`), not the repository root. Add it to your component's `.gitignore`.

**Template for teams**: Provide `.terraformrc.example` with placeholder paths that team members update for their environment.

**CLI configuration only**: The `provider_installation` block must be in a Terraform CLI config file, not in `.tf` files.

**Absolute paths**: Use absolute paths to the directory containing the provider binary.

**Warning message**: Terraform shows "Warning: Provider development overrides are in effect" when using local providers.
