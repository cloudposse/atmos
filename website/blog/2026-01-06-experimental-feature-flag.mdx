Atmos now provides granular control over experimental features with the new `settings.experimental` configuration option—giving teams the flexibility to explore new capabilities safely while maintaining stability in production environments.

<!--truncate-->

## What's New

Experimental features in Atmos are now clearly marked and controllable. The new `settings.experimental` configuration option lets you choose how Atmos handles experimental commands:

- **`warn`** (default) — Show a notification when running experimental commands, then continue
- **`silence`** — Run experimental commands without any notification
- **`disable`** — Block experimental commands entirely
- **`error`** — Show notification and exit with an error code

### CLI Visibility

Experimental commands are now clearly marked in help output with an `[EXPERIMENTAL]` badge:

```
AVAILABLE COMMANDS

      devcontainer [command] [EXPERIMENTAL]  Manage development containers
      terraform                              Execute terraform commands
      toolchain [command] [EXPERIMENTAL]     Manage CLI tool versions
```

When you run `--help` on an experimental command, you'll see a prominent badge at the top:

```
[EXPERIMENTAL]

Manage development containers with full lifecycle support.
```

## Configuration

Control experimental features in `atmos.yaml`:

```yaml
settings:
  # Control experimental feature handling
  # Values: "silence", "disable", "warn" (default), "error"
  experimental: warn
```

Or via environment variable:

```bash
export ATMOS_EXPERIMENTAL=disable
```

## Current Experimental Features

The following features are currently marked as experimental:

| Feature | Command | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Devcontainers | `atmos devcontainer` | Development container lifecycle management |
| Toolchain | `atmos toolchain` | Tool version management and installation |
| Backend Provisioning | `atmos terraform backend` | Terraform state backend management |
| Workdir Management | `atmos terraform workdir` | Component working directory management |
| Affected Components | `atmos list affected` | Identify changes for targeted CI/CD |

## Use Cases

### Development Environment

For local development where you want to experiment with new features:

```yaml
settings:
  experimental: warn  # See warnings but continue working
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

For continuous integration where you want stability:

```yaml
settings:
  experimental: disable  # Block experimental commands in CI
```

### Production Environment

For production where experimental features must be explicitly enabled:

```yaml
settings:
  experimental: error  # Require explicit opt-in
```

## Why This Matters

As Atmos continues to evolve, we're adding powerful new capabilities like devcontainers, toolchain management, and advanced Terraform features. These features need real-world testing before they're considered stable.

The experimental feature flag gives you:

- **Clear visibility** — Know immediately when you're using an experimental feature
- **Granular control** — Choose how to handle experimental features per environment
- **Safe exploration** — Try new features locally while keeping CI stable
- **Predictable behavior** — Same configuration works identically across environments
