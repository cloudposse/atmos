The fundamental problem with infrastructure dependencies isn't just keeping up—it's **getting left behind**. Today we're excited to announce two new commands that break this cycle: `atmos vendor update` and `atmos vendor diff`.

<!--truncate-->

## The Real Problem: Compounding Technical Debt

The harder it is to update your infrastructure components, the more likely you'll fall behind. And once you fall behind, each passing day makes updates exponentially harder:

**The Vicious Cycle:**
1. **Updates are manual and risky** → You delay them
2. **Delays accumulate** → Your components drift further from upstream
3. **The gap widens** → Breaking changes pile up across multiple versions
4. **Fear increases** → Updates become "migration projects" instead of routine maintenance
5. **You're stuck** → Trapped on old versions with security vulnerabilities and missing features

**The Cost of Falling Behind:**

This isn't just about missing new features—it's about **losing access to the core value of open source**:

- **Security patches**: Vulnerabilities get fixed upstream, but you're still exposed
- **Bug fixes**: Issues you're working around have already been solved
- **Community support**: Maintainers support current versions, not year-old releases
- **Continuous improvement**: Performance optimizations, new capabilities, better patterns
- **Compatibility**: Modern cloud services evolve; old components break

### The Shared Responsibility Model

AWS promotes the [Shared Responsibility Model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) for cloud security—AWS secures the infrastructure, you secure what runs on it. The same principle applies to open source infrastructure components:

- **Upstream maintainers**: Provide security patches, bug fixes, and improvements
- **Your team**: Keep your components up-to-date to receive those benefits

When you vendor components but never update them, you're abandoning your half of the shared responsibility model. You lose access to the continuous stream of patches, fixes, and improvements that make open source valuable.

**The harder it is to update, the more you get left in the dust.**

## The Challenge We're Solving

Before today, updating vendored components meant:

- Manually checking GitHub releases or tags for new versions
- Editing `vendor.yaml` to update version numbers
- Running `atmos vendor pull` to download new versions
- Using external tools to diff the changes
- Hoping you didn't introduce breaking changes
- Repeating this process for every component, every time

This manual overhead creates **update friction**—the resistance that keeps teams on old versions even when they know they should update.

## The Solution

We've added two powerful commands that automate this workflow while giving you complete control and visibility.

### atmos vendor update

Automatically check for and update to newer versions of vendored components, with intelligent version constraints to ensure safe updates.

```bash
# Update a specific component
atmos vendor update --component vpc

# Update all components
atmos vendor update --all

# Dry run to see what would be updated
atmos vendor update --all --dry-run
```

**Key Features:**

- **Semantic version constraints**: Use caret (`^`), tilde (`~`), ranges, or wildcards
- **Version exclusion**: Blacklist specific versions or patterns
- **Pre-release filtering**: Automatically skip alpha/beta/rc versions
- **Dry run mode**: Preview updates before making changes
- **Automatic vendor.yaml updates**: Updates version fields in place

### atmos vendor diff

Compare two versions of a component before updating, with GitHub's native diff integration for rich, formatted output.

```bash
# Diff current version against latest
atmos vendor diff --component vpc

# Diff between specific versions
atmos vendor diff --component vpc --from 1.323.0 --to 1.400.0

# Focus on specific files
atmos vendor diff --component vpc --file main.tf

# Control output format
atmos vendor diff --component vpc --context 10 --no-color
```

**Key Features:**

- **GitHub Compare API integration**: Rich, formatted diffs for GitHub sources
- **File-specific diffs**: Focus on just the files you care about
- **Customizable context**: Control how many lines of context to show
- **Color/no-color output**: Terminal-friendly or pipeline-ready
- **Version comparison**: Compare any two versions, not just current vs. latest

## How It Works

### Version Constraints

Define update rules directly in your `vendor.yaml`:

```yaml
sources:
  - component: "vpc"
    source: "github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components//modules/vpc?ref={{.Version}}"
    version: "1.323.0"  # Current pinned version
    constraints:
      version: "^1.0.0"           # Stay on v1.x, allow minor/patch updates
      excluded_versions:
        - "1.100.0"                # Skip version with breaking bug
        - "1.5.*"                  # Skip problematic 1.5.x series
      no_prereleases: true         # Only stable releases
    targets:
      - "components/terraform/vpc"
```

**Constraint Syntax:**

- **Caret (`^`)**: Compatible updates (minor and patch)
  - `^1.0.0` → allows `1.0.0` to `1.999.999`, blocks `2.0.0`
- **Tilde (`~`)**: Patch-level updates only
  - `~1.2.0` → allows `1.2.0` to `1.2.999`, blocks `1.3.0`
- **Ranges**: Explicit boundaries
  - `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` → any 1.x version
- **Wildcards**: Flexible matching
  - `1.x` or `1.*` → any 1.x version

### Update Process

When you run `atmos vendor update --component vpc`:

1. **Fetch available versions** from the source repository
2. **Apply constraints** to filter valid versions
3. **Exclude blacklisted versions** from consideration
4. **Filter pre-releases** if configured
5. **Select latest remaining version**
6. **Update `vendor.yaml`** with new version
7. **Pull new component** (or use `--dry-run` to preview)

### Diff Workflow

Before updating, review what changed:

```bash
# Step 1: Check for updates
atmos vendor update --component vpc --dry-run

# Output:
# Component "vpc" can be updated:
#   Current version: 1.323.0
#   Latest version:  1.400.0

# Step 2: Review the diff
atmos vendor diff --component vpc --from 1.323.0 --to 1.400.0

# Output shows GitHub-style diff of all changes

# Step 3: If satisfied, update
atmos vendor update --component vpc
```

## Real-World Examples

### Safe Automated Updates

Lock to major versions while allowing safe updates:

```yaml
sources:
  - component: "eks"
    source: "github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-eks-cluster?ref={{.Version}}"
    version: "2.5.0"
    constraints:
      version: "^2.0.0"        # Stay on v2, allow minor/patch
      no_prereleases: true      # Production stability
    targets:
      - "components/terraform/eks"
```

### Avoiding Known Issues

Skip specific problematic versions:

```yaml
sources:
  - component: "rds"
    source: "github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-rds?ref={{.Version}}"
    version: "1.10.0"
    constraints:
      version: "^1.0.0"
      excluded_versions:
        - "1.5.0"      # Has critical bug
        - "1.6.*"      # Entire series has issues
    targets:
      - "components/terraform/rds"
```

### Controlled Pre-release Testing

Test pre-releases in dev, stable in prod:

```yaml
# dev/vendor.yaml
sources:
  - component: "app"
    version: "2.0.0-beta.5"
    constraints:
      version: "^2.0.0-0"  # Allow pre-releases
    targets:
      - "components/terraform/app"

# prod/vendor.yaml
sources:
  - component: "app"
    version: "1.8.0"
    constraints:
      version: "^1.0.0"
      no_prereleases: true   # Stable only
    targets:
      - "components/terraform/app"
```

### Bulk Updates with Review

Update all components safely:

```bash
# 1. See what would change
atmos vendor update --all --dry-run

# 2. Review diffs for critical components
atmos vendor diff --component vpc
atmos vendor diff --component eks
atmos vendor diff --component rds

# 3. Update everything
atmos vendor update --all
```

## Multi-Provider Architecture

The diff functionality uses a provider-based architecture:

- **GitHub sources**: Full diff support using GitHub Compare API
- **Generic Git sources**: Basic operations, diff returns "not implemented"
- **Other sources** (OCI, local, HTTP): Gracefully handled with clear errors

This design allows us to provide the best experience for each source type while maintaining a consistent interface.

## Integration with CI/CD

Automate dependency updates in your pipelines:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/update-components.yml
name: Update Vendored Components
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 1'  # Weekly on Monday
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  update:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install Atmos
        run: |
          curl -L https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/releases/download/vX.X.X/atmos -o /usr/local/bin/atmos
          chmod +x /usr/local/bin/atmos

      - name: Check for updates
        id: check
        run: |
          atmos vendor update --all --dry-run > updates.txt
          cat updates.txt

      - name: Create PR if updates available
        if: contains(steps.check.outputs.stdout, 'can be updated')
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v5
        with:
          commit-message: "chore: Update vendored components"
          title: "Update Vendored Components"
          body: |
            Automated component updates detected.

            ```
            $(cat updates.txt)
            ```

            Review the diffs and merge if acceptable.
          branch: automated-vendor-updates
```

## Error Handling and Safety

Both commands provide comprehensive error handling:

- **Version not found**: Clear message with available versions
- **Constraint syntax errors**: Helpful validation messages
- **Network issues**: Graceful degradation with retry suggestions
- **No updates available**: Informative message about current state
- **Unsupported sources**: Clear explanation of capabilities per source type

## Migration Guide

Existing `vendor.yaml` files work without changes. To add constraints:

```yaml
# Before (still works)
sources:
  - component: "vpc"
    source: "github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components//modules/vpc?ref={{.Version}}"
    version: "1.323.0"
    targets:
      - "components/terraform/vpc"

# After (with automated updates)
sources:
  - component: "vpc"
    source: "github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-components//modules/vpc?ref={{.Version}}"
    version: "1.323.0"
    constraints:          # Add this section
      version: "^1.0.0"
      no_prereleases: true
    targets:
      - "components/terraform/vpc"
```

## Why This Matters: Breaking the Update Debt Cycle

These commands fundamentally change the economics of staying current:

**Eliminate Update Friction**: What took hours now takes seconds. No more manual version hunting, no more copy-pasting diffs from GitHub.

**Maintain Shared Responsibility**: Upstream maintainers hold up their end by shipping patches and improvements. These tools make it trivial for you to hold up yours by staying current.

**Prevent Technical Debt Accumulation**: Small, frequent updates are easier than large, infrequent migrations. Automate the small updates to avoid the painful migrations.

**Preserve Open Source Value**: Access the continuous stream of security patches, bug fixes, and improvements that make open source powerful. Don't vendor once and forget—vendor and evolve.

**Reduce Risk Through Visibility**: Diff before updating. See exactly what changed. Make informed decisions instead of blind updates.

**Enable Automation**: Integrate into CI/CD pipelines. Get weekly update PRs automatically. Review and merge instead of hunting and gathering.

The goal isn't just to make updates easier—it's to **make falling behind harder**. By removing update friction, we make staying current the path of least resistance.

## Technical Implementation

For contributors and the curious:

- **Provider interface pattern**: Clean abstraction for different source types
- **GitHub Compare API**: Native integration for rich diffs
- **Semver library**: Industry-standard constraint parsing
- **Error wrapping**: Comprehensive error context for debugging
- **Performance tracking**: Instrumented for monitoring and optimization
