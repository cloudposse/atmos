Atmos now supports automatic version switching, making it easy to pin projects to specific Atmos versions and ensure consistency across teams.

<!--truncate-->

## What Changed

Atmos can now automatically switch to a specific version when running commands. This works through three mechanisms:

1. **`--use-version` flag**: Run any command with a specific version
   ```bash
   atmos --use-version 1.199.0 terraform plan -s mystack
   ```

2. **`ATMOS_VERSION` environment variable**: Set the version for all commands
   ```bash
   export ATMOS_VERSION=1.199.0
   atmos terraform plan -s mystack
   ```

3. **`version.use` in atmos.yaml**: Pin your project to a specific version
   ```yaml
   version:
     use: "1.199.0"
   ```

When a version is specified, Atmos will:
- Check if that version is installed
- Install it automatically if needed (using the toolchain installer)
- Re-execute itself with the specified version

## Why This Matters

**Team Consistency**: Everyone on your team uses the same Atmos version, eliminating "works on my machine" issues.

**CI/CD Reliability**: Pin your pipelines to specific versions for reproducible builds.

**Gradual Upgrades**: Test new versions in development before rolling them out to production workflows.

## How to Use It

The simplest approach is adding `version.use` to your `atmos.yaml`:

```yaml
version:
  use: "1.199.0"
```

Now every `atmos` command in that project will use version 1.199.0, regardless of which version is installed globally.

You can also combine this with [Atmos profiles](/cli/configuration/profiles) for environment-specific versions:

```yaml
# .atmos.d/dev.yaml
version:
  use: "1.201.0"  # Latest in dev

# .atmos.d/prod.yaml
version:
  use: "1.199.0"  # Stable in prod
```
