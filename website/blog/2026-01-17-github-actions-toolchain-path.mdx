Atmos toolchain now has native GitHub Actions support with the new `github` format for `atmos toolchain env`.

<!--truncate-->

## What Changed

The `atmos toolchain env` command now supports a `github` format that outputs paths compatible with GitHub Actions' `$GITHUB_PATH` environment file. When running in GitHub Actions, it automatically detects and writes to `$GITHUB_PATH`.

### New Features

- **`--format github`**: Outputs one path per line, compatible with `$GITHUB_PATH`
- **`--output` flag**: Append output to any file instead of stdout
- **Auto-detection**: When `$GITHUB_PATH` is set, the `github` format automatically writes to it
- **Improved error messages**: Helpful hints guide you when tools aren't installed

## How to Use It

In your GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
- name: Install Atmos toolchain
  run: |
    atmos toolchain install
    atmos toolchain env --format github
```

The next step in your workflow will have access to all your toolchain binaries (OpenTofu, Terraform, Helmfile, etc.) in the PATH.

## Why This Matters

Previously, integrating Atmos toolchain with GitHub Actions required shell tricks:

```yaml
# Before: Manual PATH manipulation
- run: echo "$(atmos toolchain path)" >> $GITHUB_PATH
```

Now it's a single, intuitive command that handles everything automatically.
