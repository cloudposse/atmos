Atmos now supports importing stack configurations from remote URLs. Reference shared configurations from GitHub, S3, GCS, or any HTTP endpoint directly in your stack files.

<!--truncate-->

## What Changed

Stack imports now support remote URLs alongside local file paths. The import syntax remains the same, but Atmos detects remote URLs and downloads them automatically using go-getter:

```yaml
import:
  # Local import - works as before
  - catalog/base

  # Remote imports - NEW
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudposse/atmos/main/stacks/catalog/shared.yaml
  - github.com/myorg/shared-config//stacks/defaults.yaml?ref=v1.0.0
  - s3::https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-bucket/configs/base.yaml
```

## Why This Matters

Teams often need to share stack configurations across multiple repositories or organizations. Previously, this required vendoring shared configs or maintaining copies in each repository. Now you can reference shared configurations directly from their source:

- **Central catalogs**: Maintain organization-wide defaults in a single repository
- **Version pinning**: Reference specific versions with Git refs (`?ref=v1.0.0`)
- **Cross-team sharing**: Import configurations from other teams without duplication
- **External standards**: Pull in compliance or security baselines from external sources

## Supported URL Formats

Remote imports support all go-getter URL formats:

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| HTTPS | `https://example.com/config.yaml` |
| GitHub | `github.com/org/repo//path/to/file.yaml` |
| Git with ref | `github.com/org/repo//path?ref=v1.0.0` |
| S3 | `s3::https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/key.yaml` |
| GCS | `gcs::gs://bucket/path/config.yaml` |
| Git SSH | `git@github.com:org/repo.git//path/to/file.yaml` |

## How to Use It

### Basic Remote Import

Reference a remote configuration directly:

```yaml
# stacks/deploy/production.yaml
import:
  - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/myorg/shared-configs/main/base.yaml

vars:
  environment: production

components:
  terraform:
    vpc:
      vars:
        cidr_block: "10.0.0.0/16"
```

### Version-Pinned Imports

Pin imports to specific Git refs for reproducibility:

```yaml
import:
  # Pin to a specific tag
  - github.com/myorg/shared-configs//catalog/defaults.yaml?ref=v2.1.0

  # Pin to a specific commit
  - github.com/myorg/shared-configs//catalog/security.yaml?ref=abc123
```

### Skip Missing Remote Imports

Use `skip_if_missing` for optional remote configurations:

```yaml
import:
  - path: "https://internal.example.com/optional-overrides.yaml"
    skip_if_missing: true
```

## Example

We've added a complete example demonstrating remote stack imports:

```bash
cd examples/remote-stack-imports
atmos describe stacks
```

The example shows both local and remote imports working together, with proper configuration merging and inheritance.

:::note
This feature was previously documented but not yet implemented. We apologize for this oversight. Remote stack imports now work as documented, exactly like [remote imports for atmos.yaml](/cli/configuration/imports).
