# Components folder

This folder is meant to house components that are used across multiple versions. For components that are meant to be used in a specific version only,
consider putting them directly in `/docs/` in the appropriate subfolder. [See here](/docs/README.md#Versioning) for more details.

## Global

Global components are used on many pages spanning many sections.

## Page

Page components are confined to a section of pages or a single page. The layout of this directory is meant to mirror
the [directory used for routing](/docs)
