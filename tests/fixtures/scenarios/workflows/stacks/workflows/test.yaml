  # Test cases for multi-component operations with quoted arguments
  # These test the issue where strings.Fields() incorrectly splits quoted arguments

  # This workflow tests the --query flag with a quoted expression
  # The query contains spaces and special characters that should be preserved
  multi-component-query:
    description: |
      Test multi-component operation with --query flag containing quoted expression.
      This reproduces the issue where strings.Fields() splits the quoted query.
    steps:
      # This command should be parsed as a single query argument:
      #   ["terraform", "plan", "--query", ".settings.enabled == true", "-s", "nonprod"]
      # But strings.Fields() incorrectly splits the quoted query into multiple tokens:
      #   ["terraform", "plan", "--query", "'.settings.enabled", "==", "true'", "-s", "nonprod"]
      # which causes the CLI to interpret "'.settings.enabled" as a component argument.
      - command: terraform plan --query '.settings.enabled == true' -s nonprod

  # This workflow tests the --components flag with comma-separated values

      - command: terraform plan --components mock -s nonprod

  # Test cases for -var flag with quoted values
  # This reproduces the issue reported by users where -var="key=value" is incorrectly parsed
  # https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/issues/XXXX

  # Test -var with double quotes (the exact pattern from user report)
  terraform-var-double-quotes:
    description: |
      Test terraform -var flag with double-quoted value.
      This reproduces the issue where strings.Fields() keeps quotes as literal characters,
      causing Terraform to see the variable name as "enabled instead of enabled.
    steps:
      # The command should pass -var=enabled=false to terraform
      # But with strings.Fields(), it passes -var="enabled=false" (with literal quotes)
      - command: terraform plan mock -var="enabled=false" -s nonprod

  # Test -var with single quotes
