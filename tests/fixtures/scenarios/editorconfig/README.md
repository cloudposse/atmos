# Atmos Editor Config Test Scenarios

This directory contains configurations specifically designed to test and validate the behavior of editor configurations when working with Atmos.

These files include intentionally broken examples and edge cases to help ensure that editors and tools handle Atmos configurations correctly. 

**Do not use these examples for actual deployments.**
