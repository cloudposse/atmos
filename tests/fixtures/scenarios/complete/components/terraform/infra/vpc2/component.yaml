# This is an example of how to download a Terraform component from an OCI registry (https://opencontainers.org), e.g., GitHub Public GHCR.

# The 'component.yaml' file in the component folder is processed by 'atmos' commands:
# 'atmos vendor pull -c infra/myapp' or 'atmos vendor pull --component infra/myapp'.
apiVersion: atmos/v1
kind: ComponentVendorConfig

    # Source 'uri' supports the following protocols: OCI (https://opencontainers.org), Git, Mercurial, HTTP, HTTPS, Amazon S3, Google GCP,
    # and all URL and archive formats as described in https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter
    # In 'uri', Golang templates are supported  https://pkg.go.dev/text/template
    # If 'version' is provided, '{{.Version}}' will be replaced with the 'version' value before pulling the files from 'uri'
    # Download the component from the AWS public ECR registry (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/public/public-registries.html)

    # If 'included_paths' is not specified, all files will be matched except those that match the patterns from 'excluded_paths'
