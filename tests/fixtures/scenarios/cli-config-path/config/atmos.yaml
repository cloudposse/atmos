# This atmos.yaml is in a subdirectory (config/) while stacks/ and components/
# are at the root level. This tests the scenario where:
# - ATMOS_CLI_CONFIG_PATH=./config
# - base_path uses ".." to reference the parent directory (repo root)
# - stacks/ and components/ directories are at the repo root
#
# This validates that paths starting with ".." or "./" resolve relative to the
# atmos.yaml location, while simple relative paths resolve relative to CWD.
