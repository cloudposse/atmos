# Description: This is an example of a custom import configuration file.
# The import configuration file is used to load configurations from multiple files and directories.
# The configurations are merged together to create a single configuration object.
# The configurations are loaded in the order they are defined in the import section.

  # Note: Remote URL import removed because main branch atmos.yaml has custom commands
  # with flags that conflict with built-in commands. The local imports below demonstrate
  # the import functionality without causing flag conflicts.
  - "configs.d/**/*"   # Recursively load configurations from a directory
  - "./logs.yaml"      # Load a specific file
