# Packer component with BOTH source AND workdir enabled
# This demonstrates the combined workflow for packer:
# 1. When workdir enabled, vendors directly to .workdir/packer/<stack>-ami-workdir/
# 2. Packer runs in the isolated workdir

components:
  packer:
    ami-workdir:
      source:
        uri: "github.com/aws-samples/amazon-eks-custom-amis"
        version: "main"
        included_paths:
          - "*.pkr.hcl"
          - "*.pkrvars.hcl"
        excluded_paths:
          - "*.md"
      provision:
        workdir:
          enabled: true
      vars:
        enabled: true
        environment: "packer-source-with-workdir"
