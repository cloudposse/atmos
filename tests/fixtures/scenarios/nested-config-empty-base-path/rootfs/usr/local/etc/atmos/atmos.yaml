# Test fixture: Nested config with empty base_path
#
# Scenario:
# - atmos.yaml is in a deeply nested subdirectory (rootfs/usr/local/etc/atmos/)
# - base_path is empty ("") - expects git repo root
# - stacks/ and components/ are at the repo root
# - ATMOS_CLI_CONFIG_PATH=./rootfs/usr/local/etc/atmos
#
# Expected behavior: Empty base_path should trigger git root discovery,
# resolving to the repo root, not the atmos.yaml directory.
#
# See: https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/issues/1858
