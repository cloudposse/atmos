# Error

directory for Atmos stacks does not exist

## Explanation

The atmos.yaml config file specifies the stacks directory as stacks, but the resolved absolute path does not exist:

 /stacks

## Hints

ðŸ’¡ Unset base_path in atmos.yaml to use auto-detection (recommended) ðŸ’¡ Run Atmos from your Git repository root - it will auto-detect paths ðŸ’¡ Or set base_path to the directory containing your atmos.yaml
