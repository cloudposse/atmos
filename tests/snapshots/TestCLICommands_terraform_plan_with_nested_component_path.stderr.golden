# Error

**Error:** ambiguous component path

## Hints

💡 Path resolves to infra/vpc which is referenced by multiple components in
stack tenant1-ue2-dev Matching components: infra/vpc, vpc, vpc/new

💡 Use the exact component name instead of a path Example: atmos terraform
<command> infra/vpc --stack tenant1-ue2-dev
