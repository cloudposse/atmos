# Error

**Error:** path is not within Atmos component directories

## Hints

💡 Path points to the stacks configuration directory, not a component: /absolute/path/to/repo/tests/fixtures/scenarios/complete/stacks

Stacks directory: /absolute/path/to/repo/tests/fixtures/scenarios/complete/stacks

💡 Components are located in component directories (terraform, helmfile, packer)
Change to a component directory and use . or provide a path within a component
directory
