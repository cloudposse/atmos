# Error

**Error:** path is not within Atmos component directories

## Hints

💡 Path
/absolute/path/to/external
conductor/hanoi/tests/fixtures/scenarios/complete/stacks
points to the stacks configuration directory, not a component

Stacks directory:
/absolute/path/to/external
conductor/hanoi/tests/fixtures/scenarios/complete/stacks

💡 Components are located in component directories (terraform, helmfile, packer)
Change to a component directory and use . or provide a path within a component
directory
