# Error

invalid workflow manifest

## Explanation

The workflow manifest stacks/workflows/test-invalid.yaml must be a map with the top-level workflows: key.

## Example

 workflows:
   deploy-vpc:
     description: Deploy VPC infrastructure
     steps:
       - command: terraform apply vpc -s prod
       - command: terraform apply vpn -s prod

   deploy-eks:
     description: Deploy EKS cluster
     steps:
       - command: terraform apply eks -s prod

## Hints

ðŸ’¡ Check the YAML structure of your workflow file ðŸ’¡ Valid format requires a top-level workflows: key containing workflow definitions
