      # Clean up Dependabot's auto-added semver labels
      # 
      # Dependabot automatically adds semver labels (major/minor/patch) based on 
      # the version changes of dependencies. However, dependency updates do not 
      # directly correspond to new Atmos releases. Atmos follows its own versioning
      # based on features and functionality changes, not dependency versions.
      # 
      # Dependency updates are bundled together with feature releases, so all 
      # Dependabot PRs should only have the 'no-release' label.
      #
      # NOTE: There is currently no way to disable Dependabot's automatic semver labeling.
      # See the following GitHub issues for more context:
      # - https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/3465 (Opt-out of default major/minor/patch labels)
      # - https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/11783 (labels: [] regression)
      # - https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/1871 (Why labels are automatically applied)
      #
      # This workflow step is a workaround until GitHub provides native support for
      # disabling automatic semver labels on Dependabot PRs.
