  > ### Automated Terraform Management & Orchestration Software (ATMOS)

  Atmos simplifies complex cloud architectures and DevOps workflows into [intuitive CLI commands](https://atmos.tools/category/cli).
  Its strength in managing [DRY configurations at scale](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/) is supported by robust
  [design patterns](https://atmos.tools/design-patterns/), comprehensive [documentation](https://atmos.tools/), and a
  [passionate community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/), making it a versatile [tool for both startups and enterprises](https://cloudposse.com/).
  Atmos is extensible to accommodate any tooling, including enterprise-scale Terraform, and includes
  [policy controls](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/components/validation), [vendoring](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/vendoring/),
  and [GitOps capabilities](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions) out of the box. Everything is open source and free.

introduction: |-

  [Atmos](https://atmos.tools) centralizes the DevOps chain and cloud automation/orchestration into a robust command-line tool,
  streamlining environments and workflows into straightforward CLI commands. Leveraging advanced hierarchical configurations,
  it efficiently orchestrates both local and CI/CD pipeline tasks, optimizing infrastructure management for engineers and cloud 
  architects alike. You can then run the CLI anywhere, such as locally or in CI/CD.

  The Atmos project consists of a command-line tool, a `Go` library, and even a terraform provider.  It provides numerous
  [conventions](https://atmos.tools/design-patterns/) to help you provision, manage, and orchestrate workflows across various toolchains.
  You can even access the configurations natively from within terraform using our [`terraform-provider-utils`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-provider-utils/).

  [Cloud Posse](https://cloudposse.com/) uses this tool extensively for automating cloud infrastructure with
  [Terraform](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), but it can be used to automate any complex workflow.

  > [!TIP]
  > ### Did you know?
  >
  > By leveraging Atmos in conjunction with Cloud Posse's [*expertise in AWS*](https://cloudposse.com),
  > [*terraform blueprints*](https://cloudposse.com/services/), and our [*knowledgeable community*](https://slack.cloudposse.com), teams can achieve
  > operational mastery and innovation faster, transforming their infrastructure management practices into a competitive advantage.

  ## Core Features

  Atmos streamlines Terraform orchestration, environment, and configuration management, offering developers and DevOps a set of
  powerful tools to tackle deployment challenges. Designed to be cloud agnostic, it enables you to operate consistently across
  various cloud platforms. These features boost efficiency, clarity, and control across various environments, making it an
  indispensable asset for managing complex infrastructures with confidence.

  - [**Terminal UI**](https://atmos.tools/cli) Polished interface for easier interaction with Terraform, workflows, and commands.
  - [**Native Terraform Support:**](https://atmos.tools/cli/commands/terraform/usage) Orchestration, backend generation, varfile generation, ensuring compatibility with vanilla Terraform.
  - [**Stacks:**](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/stacks) Powerful abstraction layer defined in YAML for orchestrating and deploying components.
  - [**Components:**](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/components) A generic abstraction for deployable units, such as Terraform "root" modules.
  - [**Vendoring:**](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/vendoring) Pulls dependencies from remote sources, supporting immutable infrastructure practices.
  - [**Custom Commands:**](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/custom-commands) Extends Atmos's functionality, allowing integration of any command with stack configurations.
  - [**Workflow Orchestration:**](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/workflows) Comprehensive support for managing the lifecycle of cloud infrastructure from initiation to maintenance.

  ## Use Cases

  Atmos has consistently demonstrated its effectiveness in addressing these key use-cases, showcasing its adaptability and
  strength in the cloud infrastructure and DevOps domains:

  - **Managing Large Multi-Account Cloud Environments:** Suitable for organizations using multiple cloud accounts to separate different
    projects or stages of development.
  - **Cross-Platform Cloud Architectures:** Ideal for businesses that need to manage configuration of services across AWS, GCP, Azure, etc., to
    build a cohesive system.
  - **Multi-Tenant Systems for SaaS:** Perfect for SaaS companies looking to host multiple customers within a unified infrastructure.
    Simply define a baseline tenant configuration once, and then seamlessly onboard new tenants by reusing this baseline through pure
    configuration, bypassing the need for further code development.
  - **Efficient Multi-Region Deployments:** Atmos facilitates streamlined multi-region deployments by enabling businesses to define baseline
    configurations with [stacks](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/stacks/) and extend them across regions with DRY principles through
    [imports](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/stacks/imports) and [inheritance](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/components/inheritance).
  - **Compliant Infrastructure for Regulated Industries:** Atmos empowers DevOps and SecOps teams to create vetted configurations that comply
    with SOC2, HIPAA, HITRUST, PCI, and other regulatory standards. These configurations can then be efficiently shared and reused across the
    organization via [service catalogs](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/stacks/catalogs), [component libraries](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/components/library),
    [vendoring](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/vendoring), and [OPA policies](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/components/validation),
    simplifying the process of achieving and maintaining rigorous compliance.
  - **Empowering Teams with Self-Service Infrastructure:** Allows teams to manage their infrastructure needs independently, using
    predefined templates and policies.
  - **Streamlining Deployment with Service Catalogs, Landing Zones, and Blueprints:** Provides ready-to-use templates and guidelines for
    setting up cloud environments quickly and consistently.

  Moreover, `atmos` is not only a command-line interface for managing clouds and clusters. It provides many useful patterns
  and best practices, such as:
  - Enforces a project structure convention, so everybody knows where to find things.
  - Provides clear separation of configuration from code, so the same code is easily deployed to different regions, environments and stages
  - It can be extended to include new features, commands, and workflows
  - The commands have a clean, consistent and easy to understand syntax
  - The CLI code is modular and self-documenting
