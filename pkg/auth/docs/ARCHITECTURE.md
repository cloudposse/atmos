# Atmos Auth Package Architecture

## Overview

The Atmos Auth package provides a comprehensive authentication framework for cloud providers, supporting identity chaining, credential management, and environment setup for tools like Terraform. The architecture is designed to be extensible, allowing easy addition of new cloud providers and authentication methods.

## Core Interfaces

### AuthManager

The central orchestrator that manages the entire authentication process:

- **Authenticate()**: Performs authentication for a specified identity
- **Whoami()**: Returns information about identity credentials
- **GetDefaultIdentity()**: Handles multiple defaults with CI detection
- **GetProviderForIdentity()**: Resolves the root provider for an identity
- **GetProviderKindForIdentity()**: Returns provider kind via chain resolution
- **GetChain()**: Exposes the last-built chain for inspection

### Provider

Represents authentication providers (e.g., AWS SSO, SAML):

- **Kind()**: Returns provider kind (e.g., "aws/iam-identity-center")
- **Name()**: Returns configured provider name
- **PreAuthenticate()**: Inspect chain before auth and set preferences
- **Authenticate()**: Performs provider-level authentication
- **Validate()**: Validates provider configuration
- **Environment()**: Returns provider-level environment variables

### Identity

Represents authentication identities that use provider credentials:

- **Kind()**: Returns identity type (e.g., "aws/permission-set")
- **GetProviderName()**: Resolves root provider name for this identity
- **Authenticate()**: Performs identity-level authentication using base credentials
- **Validate()**: Validates identity configuration
- **Environment()**: Returns identity-level environment variables
- **PostAuthenticate()**: Perform file/env setup after successful auth

## Authentication Flow

### 1. Identity Chain Resolution

```
Component Request → Identity → Provider Chain → Root Provider
```

Example: `terraform apply` with identity `sandbox-admin`:

1. Resolve identity chain: `sandbox-admin` → `managers` → `cplive-sso`
   a. `sandbox-admin` is the target identity (kind: `aws/assume-role`)
   b. `managers` is the via identity (kind: `aws/permission-set`)
   c. `cplive-sso` is the root provider (kind: `aws/iam-identity-center`)
2. Build authentication chain: `[cplive-sso, managers, sandbox-admin]`
3. Execute sequential authentication

### 2. Sequential Authentication

```go
	finalCreds, err := m.authenticateHierarchical(ctx, identityName)
```

We traverse the chain, checking for cached credentials. We start at the target identity, and if that already has cached credentials, we can use that. Otherwise, we go down until we have cached credentials, and then we refresh the credentials going back up.

If we reach the bottom, which is the provider, then we know that we have to re-authenticate the entire thing. This typically just involves authenticating with the provider again, and then assuming roles.

### 3. Environment Setup

Environment setup is performed by identities via `PostAuthenticate` using the shared AWS helpers:

```go
// Inside Identity.PostAuthenticate
aws.SetupFiles(providerName, identityName, creds)
aws.SetEnvironmentVariables(stackInfo, providerName, identityName)
```

This, of course, is AWS specific, but the `PostAuthenticate` hook allows us to do special things that maybe a cloud provider—or that particular identity—might need.

## Key Design Patterns

### Factory Pattern

- `NewProvider()` and `NewIdentity()` create instances based on configuration
- Extensible for adding new provider/identity types
- Type-safe construction with validation

### Chain of Responsibility

- Identity chains allow credential transformation through multiple steps
- Each identity receives credentials from the previous step
- Supports complex authentication scenarios (SSO → Permission Set → Assume Role)

### Strategy Pattern

- Cloud-specific helper packages encapsulate differences (e.g., `pkg/auth/cloud/aws`).
- Identities and providers call helper functions directly; no shared `CloudProvider` interface.
- Environment setup varies by cloud and is implemented in helper packages.

### Repository Pattern

- `CredentialStore` abstracts credential persistence
- Supports multiple storage backends (keyring, file, etc.)
- Encrypted storage with expiration handling

## Configuration Schema

### Providers

```yaml
providers:
  cplive-sso:
    kind: aws/iam-identity-center
    region: us-east-1
    start_url: https://cplive.awsapps.com/start
```

### Identities

```yaml
identities:
  sandbox-admin:
    kind: aws/permission-set
    default: true
    via:
      provider: cplive-sso
    principal:
      name: AdminAccess
      account:
        name: "123456789012"
```

### Identity Chaining

```yaml
identities:
  final-role:
    kind: aws/assume-role
    via:
      identity: sandbox-admin # Chain through another identity
    principal:
      assume_role: arn:aws:iam::999999999999:role/FinalRole
```

## Error Handling

### Validation Errors

- Configuration validation occurs at startup
- Circular dependency detection in identity chains
- Provider/identity reference validation

### Authentication Errors

- Graceful handling of expired credentials
- Clear error messages indicating which step failed
- Automatic retry for transient failures

### Environment Errors

- File permission handling for credential files
- Environment variable conflict detection
- Cleanup on failure scenarios

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Individual component testing with mocks
- Interface compliance testing
- Error condition coverage

### Integration Tests

- End-to-end authentication flows
- CLI command testing with golden snapshots
- Multi-provider scenario testing

### Test Helpers

- Mock implementations for all interfaces
- Test credential generation utilities
- Environment isolation for tests

## Notes on Current Scope

- Cloud-specific behavior is implemented via helper packages (e.g., `pkg/auth/cloud/aws`) and used by identities in `PostAuthenticate`.
- There is no shared `CloudProvider`, `CloudProviderFactory`, or `CloudProviderManager` abstraction.
- The previous `config/` and `environment/` packages mentioned in older docs do not exist; environment merging is handled via `pkg/auth/utils/env.go` and stack info.

## Performance Considerations

### Credential Caching

- Encrypted credential storage with expiration
- Avoid re-authentication for valid credentials
- Cache invalidation on configuration changes

### File Operations

- Atomic file writes for credential files
- Proper file permissions (0600) for security
- Cleanup of temporary files

### Memory Management

- Secure credential handling in memory
- Zero-out sensitive data after use
- Minimal credential lifetime in memory

## Security Features

### Credential Protection

- Encrypted storage using OS keyring
- Secure memory handling for credentials
- Automatic credential expiration

### File Security

- Restricted file permissions (0600)
- Provider-specific credential isolation
- No modification of user's existing AWS files

### Environment Isolation

- Provider-specific environment variables
- No global environment pollution
- Clean separation between different auth contexts

## Extensibility Points

### Adding New Cloud Providers

1. Create a helper package under `pkg/auth/cloud/<provider>/` (e.g., `aws`).
2. Implement file/env helpers (e.g., `files.go`, `setup.go`) for that cloud.
3. Have identities/providers call these helpers in `PostAuthenticate`/`Environment()` as needed.
4. Implement any credential validation helpers and add tests/docs.

### Adding New Providers/Identities

1. Implement `Provider` or `Identity` interface
2. Add to factory functions in `factory.go`
3. Add validation rules in `validator.go`
4. Create tests and documentation

### Adding New Storage Backends

1. Implement `CredentialStore` interface
2. Add configuration options
3. Implement encryption/security requirements
4. Add migration utilities if needed

This architecture provides a solid foundation for multi-cloud authentication while maintaining security, performance, and extensibility requirements.
