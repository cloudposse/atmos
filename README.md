## Introduction


`atmos` is both a library and a command-line tool for provisioning, managing and orchestrating workflows across various toolchains.
We use it extensively for automating cloud infrastructure and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) clusters.

`atmos` includes workflows for dealing with:

   - Provisioning [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) components
   - Deploying [helm](https://helm.sh/) [charts](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/) to Kubernetes clusters using [helmfile](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile)
   - Executing [helm](https://helm.sh/) commands on Kubernetes clusters
   - Provisioning [istio](https://istio.io/) on Kubernetes clusters using [istio operator](https://istio.io/latest/blog/2019/introducing-istio-operator/) and helmfile
   - Executing [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/) commands on Kubernetes clusters
   - Executing [AWS SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/) commands to orchestrate cloud infrastructure
   - Running [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) constructs to define cloud resources
   - Executing commands for the [serverless](https://www.serverless.com/) framework
   - Executing shell commands
   - Combining various commands into workflows to execute many commands sequentially in just one step
   - ... and many more

In essence, it's a tool that orchestrates the other CLI tools in a consistent and self-explaining manner.
It's a superset of all other tools and task runners (e.g. `make`, `terragrunt`, `terraform`, `aws` cli, `gcloud`, etc.)
and is intended to be used to tie everything together, so you can provide a simple CLI interface for your organization.

Moreover, `atmos` is not only a command-line interface for managing clouds and clusters. It provides many useful patterns and best practices, such as:

- Enforces Terraform and helmfile project structure (so everybody knows where things are)
- Provides separation of configuration and code (so the same code could be easily deployed to different regions, environments and stages)
- It can be extended to include new features, commands, and workflows
- The commands have a clean, consistent and easy to understand syntax
- The CLI code is modular and self-documenting

## Install

### OSX

From Homebrew directly:

```console
brew install atmos
```

### Linux

On Debian:

```console
# Add the Cloud Posse package repository hosted by Cloudsmith
apt-get update && apt-get install -y apt-utils curl
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/cloudposse/packages/cfg/setup/bash.deb.sh' | bash

# Install atmos
apt-get install atmos@="<ATMOS_VERSION>-*"
```

On Alpine:

```console
# Install the Cloud Posse package repository hosted by Cloudsmith
curl -sSL https://apk.cloudposse.com/install.sh | bash

# Install atmos
apk add atmos@cloudposse~=<ATMOS_VERSION>
```

### Go

Install the latest version

```console
go install github.com/cloudposse/atmos
```

Get a specific version

__NOTE:__ Since the version is passed in via `-ldflags` during build, when running `go install` without using `-ldflags`, 
the CLI will return `0.0.1` when running `atmos version`.

```console
go install github.com/cloudposse/atmos@v1.3.9
```

## Build from source

```console
make build
```

or run this and replace `$version` with the version that should be returned with `atmos version`.

```console
go build -o build/atmos -v -ldflags "-X 'github.com/cloudposse/atmos/cmd.Version=$version'"
```

```

## Example

The [example](examples/complete) folder contains a complete solution that shows how to:

  - Structure the Terraform and helmfile components
  - Configure the CLI
  - Add [stack configurations](examples/complete/stacks) for the Terraform and helmfile components (to provision them to different environments and stages)

## CLI Configuration

## Centralized Project Configuration

`atmos` provides separation of configuration and code, allowing you to provision the same code into different regions, environments and stages.

In our example, all the code (Terraform and helmfiles) is in the [components](examples/complete/components) folder.

The centralized stack configurations (variables for the Terraform and helmfile components) are in the [stacks](examples/complete/stacks) folder.

In the example, all stack configuration files are broken down by environments and stages and use the predefined format `$environment-$stage.yaml`.

Environments are abbreviations of AWS regions, e.g. `ue2` stands for `us-east-2`, whereas `uw2` would stand for `us-west-2`.

`$environment-globals.yaml` is where you define the global values for all stages for a particular environment.
The global values get merged with the `$environment-$stage.yaml` configuration for a specific environment/stage by the CLI.

In the example, we defined a few config files:

  - [ue2-dev.yaml](example/stacks/ue2-dev.yaml) - stack configuration (Terraform and helmfile variables) for the environment `ue2` and stage `dev`
  - [ue2-staging.yaml](example/stacks/ue2-staging.yaml) - stack configuration (Terraform and helmfile variables) for the environment `ue2` and stage `staging`
  - [ue2-prod.yaml](example/stacks/ue2-prod.yaml) - stack configuration (Terraform and helmfile variables) for the environment `ue2` and stage `prod`
  - [ue2-globals.yaml](example/stacks/ue2-globals.yaml) - global settings for the environment `ue2` (e.g. `region`, `environment`)
  - [globals.yaml](example/stacks/globals.yaml) - global settings for the entire solution

__NOTE:__ The stack configuration structure and the file names described above are just an example of how to name and structure the config files.
You can choose any file name for a stack. You can also include other configuration files (e.g. globals for the environment, and globals for the entire solution)
into a stack config using the `import` directive.

Stack configuration files have a predefined format:

```yaml
import:
  - ue2-globals

vars:
  stage: dev

terraform:
  vars: {}

helmfile:
  vars: {}

components:
  terraform:
    vpc:
      command: "/usr/bin/terraform-0.15"
      backend:
        s3:
          workspace_key_prefix: "vpc"
      vars:
        cidr_block: "10.102.0.0/18"
    eks:
      backend:
        s3:
          workspace_key_prefix: "eks"
      vars: {}

  helmfile:
    nginx-ingress:
      vars:
        installed: true
```

It has the following main sections:

- `import` - (optional) a list of stack configuration files to import and combine with the current configuration file
- `vars` - (optional) a map of variables for all components (Terraform and helmfile) in the stack
- `terraform` - (optional) configuration (variables) for all Terraform components
- `helmfile` - (optional) configuration (variables) for all helmfile components
- `components` - (required) configuration for the Terraform and helmfile components

The `components` section consists of the following:

- `terraform` - defines variables, the binary to execute, and the backend for each Terraform component.
  Terraform component names correspond to the Terraform components in the [components](example/components) folder

- `helmfile` - defines variables and the binary to execute for each helmfile component.
  Helmfile component names correspond to the helmfile components in the [helmfile](example/components/helmfile) folder


## Run the Example

To run the example, execute the following commands in a terminal:

- `cd example`
- `make all` - it will build the Docker image, build the CLI tool inside the image, and then start the container


## Provision Terraform Component

To provision a Terraform component using the `atmos` CLI, run the following commands in the container shell:

```console
atmos terraform plan eks --stack=ue2-dev
atmos terraform apply eks --stack=ue2-dev
```

where:

- `eks` is the Terraform component to provision (from the `components/terraform` folder)
- `--stack=ue2-dev` is the stack to provision the component into

Short versions of the command-line arguments can be used:

```console
atmos terraform plan eks -s ue2-dev
atmos terraform apply eks -s ue2-dev
```

To execute `plan` and `apply` in one step, use `terraform deploy` command:

```console
atmos terraform deploy eks -s ue2-dev
```

## Provision Helmfile Component

To provision a helmfile component using the `atmos` CLI, run the following commands in the container shell:

```console
atmos helmfile diff nginx-ingress --stack=ue2-dev
atmos helmfile apply nginx-ingress --stack=ue2-dev
```

where:

- `nginx-ingress` is the helmfile component to provision (from the `components/helmfile` folder)
- `--stack=ue2-dev` is the stack to provision the component into

Short versions of the command-line arguments can be used:

```console
atmos helmfile diff nginx-ingress -s ue2-dev
atmos helmfile apply nginx-ingress -s ue2-dev
```

To execute `diff` and `apply` in one step, use `helmfile deploy` command:

```console
atmos helmfile deploy nginx-ingress -s ue2-dev
```


## Workflows

Workflows are a way of combining multiple commands into one executable unit of work.

In the CLI, workflows can be defined using two different methods:

- In the configuration file for a stack (see [workflows in ue2-dev.yaml](example/stacks/ue2-dev.yaml) for an example)
- In a separate file (see [workflows.yaml](example/stacks/workflows.yaml)

In the first case, we define workflows in the configuration file for the stack (which we specify on the command line).
To execute the workflows from [workflows in ue2-dev.yaml](example/stacks/ue2-dev.yaml), run the following commands:

```console
atmos workflow deploy-all -s ue2-dev
```

Note that workflows defined in the stack config files can be executed only for the particular stack (environment and stage).
It's not possible to provision resources for multiple stacks this way.

In the second case (defining workflows in a separate file), a single workflow can be created to provision resources into different stacks.
The stacks for the workflow steps can be specified in the workflow config.

For example, to run `terraform plan` and `helmfile diff` on all terraform and helmfile components in the example, execute the following command:

```console
atmos workflow plan-all -f workflows
```

where the command-line option `-f` (`--file` for long version) instructs the `atmos` CLI to look for the `plan-all` workflow in the file [workflows](example/stacks/workflows.yaml).

As we can see, in multi-environment workflows, each workflow job specifies the stack it's operating on:

```yaml
workflows:
  plan-all:
    description: Run 'terraform plan' and 'helmfile diff' on all components for all stacks
    steps:
      - job: terraform plan vpc
        stack: ue2-dev
      - job: terraform plan eks
        stack: ue2-dev
      - job: helmfile diff nginx-ingress
        stack: ue2-dev
      - job: terraform plan vpc
        stack: ue2-staging
      - job: terraform plan eks
        stack: ue2-staging
```

You can also define a workflow in a separate file without specifying the stack in the workflow's job config.
In this case, the stack needs to be provided on the command line.

For example, to run the `deploy-all` workflow from the [workflows](example/stacks/workflows.yaml) file for the `ue2-dev` stack,
execute the following command:

```console
atmos workflow deploy-all -f workflows -s ue2-dev
```
