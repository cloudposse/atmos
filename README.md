## Introduction


[Atmos](https://atmos.tools) is a workflow automation tool. Atmos is lets you take a complex workflow and turn it into a parameterized CLI. 
You can then run the CLI anywhere, such as locally or in CI/CD.

The Atmos project consists of a command-line tool, a `Go` library, and even terraform provider.  It provides numerous conventions to help you provision, manage, and orchestrate workflows across various toolchains. You can 
even access the configurations natively from within terraform using our [`terraform-provider-utils`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-provider-utils/).

Cloud Posse uses this tool extensively for automating cloud infrastructure with [Terraform](https://hashicorp.com/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), but it can be used to automate any complex workflow.

## Common Use-cases

  `atmos` includes workflows for dealing with:

   - Provision large, multi-account[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) environments
   - Deploy [helm](https://helm.sh/) [charts](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/) to Kubernetes clusters with [helmfile](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile)
   - Execute [helm](https://helm.sh/) commands on Kubernetes clusters
   - Executing [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/) commands on Kubernetes clusters

   Here aer some other ways you can extend atmos:
   - Running [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) constructs to define cloud resources
   - Executing commands for the [serverless](https://www.serverless.com/) framework
   - Executing shell commands
   - Combining various commands into workflows to execute many commands sequentially in just one step
   - ... and many more

In essence, it's a tool that orchestrates the other CLI tools in a consistent and self-explaining manner.

It's a superset of all other tools and task runners (e.g. `make`, `terragrunt`, `terraform`, `aws` cli, `gcloud`, etc.)
and is intended to be used to tie everything together, so you can provide a simple CLI interface for your developers.

Moreover, `atmos` is not only a command-line interface for managing clouds and clusters. It provides many useful patterns and best practices, such as:

- Enforces a project structure convention, so everybody knows where to find things.
- Provides clear separation of configuration from code, so the same code is easily deployed to different regions, environments and stages)
- It can be extended to include new features, commands, and workflows
- The commands have a clean, consistent and easy to understand syntax
- The CLI code is modular and self-documenting
