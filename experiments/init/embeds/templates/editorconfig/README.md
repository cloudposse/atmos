# EditorConfig Template

This template provides a standardized `.editorconfig` file for consistent code formatting across different editors and IDEs.

## What is EditorConfig?

EditorConfig helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs. The `.editorconfig` file consists of a format for defining coding styles and a collection of text editor plugins that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles.

## Usage

Run the following command to initialize the EditorConfig file:

```bash
atmos init .editorconfig
```

This will create a `.editorconfig` file in the current directory with recommended settings for:
- Indentation style (spaces vs tabs)
- Indentation size
- End of line character
- Character encoding
- File trimming behavior

## Customization

After initialization, you can modify the `.editorconfig` file to match your project's specific coding standards and preferences.
