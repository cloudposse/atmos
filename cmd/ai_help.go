	Long: `Get intelligent help on specific Atmos topics from the AI assistant.

The AI can provide detailed explanations, examples, and best practices for various
Atmos concepts and workflows.

Common topics:
Core Concepts:
- stacks: Stack configuration and organization
- components: Component architecture and best practices
- inheritance: Configuration inheritance and precedence
- imports: Stack imports and composition
- overrides: Configuration overrides

Features:
- templating/templates: Go templating and functions
- workflows: Workflow orchestration
- validation/validate: Schema and policy validation
- vendoring/vendor: Component vendoring and mixins
- affected: Affected components detection
- catalogs: Component catalogs
- schemas/schema: JSON Schema validation
- opa/policies: OPA policy validation
- settings: Atmos settings configuration

Integrations:
- terraform: Terraform integration and best practices
- helmfile: Helmfile integration
- atlantis: Atlantis integration
- spacelift: Spacelift integration
- backends/backend: Terraform backend configuration

Examples:
  atmos ai help stacks
  atmos ai help inheritance
  atmos ai help affected
  atmos ai help terraform`,
