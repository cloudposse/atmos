# PRD: Format-Preserving YAML Editing (Get / Set / Delete) for Atmos

## Status

- **Phase 1 (core engine in `pkg/yaml`)**: implemented and tested.
- **Phase 2 — Config** (`atmos config get|set|delete`): implemented and tested
  (E2E verified).
- **Phase 2 — Stack** (`atmos stack get|set|delete`): implemented and tested;
  provenance-based file resolution + `--file` override (E2E verified).
- **Phase 2 — Vendor** (`atmos vendor get|set`): implemented and tested — version
  pinning by component name, on the shared core (generalizes the superseded
  branch's hardcoded `sources[].version` writer).
- **Follow-up within this effort**: port the remaining `feat/vendor-diff-and-update`
  feature set (`atmos vendor diff` / `atmos vendor update`, version-constraint
  resolution, git-diff, source providers) and close that branch. That branch is
  ~6 months stale relative to `main` and needs a careful rebase; the YAML-write
  path will route through this engine.

## Problem

Atmos users and automation routinely need to read and modify Atmos YAML —
`atmos.yaml` (Atmos Config), stack manifests (Stacks), and `vendor.yaml`
(Vendor) — programmatically: bump a vendored component version, flip a setting,
update a region, etc. Today this means reaching for `sed`, `yq`, or hand-editing.

These approaches are fragile:

- `sed`/regex edits are positional and unaware of YAML structure.
- A naive structured edit (unmarshal into a Go map → marshal back) **destroys
  comments, anchors/aliases, and formatting** — unacceptable for human-authored
  config that relies on comments and DRY anchors.

We want first-class Atmos commands to do this safely, preserving fidelity.

## Goals

1. A **reusable core package** (`pkg/yaml`) that can Get / Set / Delete / Format
   values in YAML **while preserving comments, anchors/aliases, formatting,
   Atmos YAML function tags (`!terraform.output`, `!env`, `!store`, …), and
   embedded Go/Gomplate templates (`{{ … }}`)**.
2. **yq-style addressing, dot-notation by default** (`vars.region`,
   `sources[0].version`), with a raw-yq escape hatch for power users.
3. **Domain-shaped commands** built on the core — one each for **Config**,
   **Stack**, and **Vendor** — optimized for that domain's schema and
   file-resolution rules. Every operation is conceptually "edit Atmos Config" or
   "edit a Stack" or "edit Vendor", not a generic raw-YAML tool.
4. **Strict anchor/alias safety**: an edit that would alter or expand an anchor
   or alias **fails loudly** rather than silently rewriting shared data.
5. Subsume the vendor diff/update feature from `feat/vendor-diff-and-update` and
   route its YAML writes through this engine.

## Non-Goals

- A general-purpose `yq` replacement CLI. The surface is domain-shaped.
- Editing remote/non-file sources.
- Reformatting that intentionally rewrites anchors (the strict guard forbids it).

## Design

### Why yq (yqlib) on raw bytes

Atmos already vendors `github.com/mikefarah/yq/v4`. The existing wrapper
`pkg/utils.EvaluateYqExpression` round-trips data **through Go types**
(`ConvertToYAML(data)`), which is why it cannot preserve formatting — by the time
yq sees the data, comments/anchors are already gone.

The key realization: feeding **raw file bytes** straight into yqlib's
`StringEvaluator` with an assignment expression edits the document **in place**,
the same way `yq -i` does, preserving comments, anchors, and aliases. This was
validated with a spike before building the engine. So the engine already exists
in-tree; we only add a raw-bytes entry point plus a safety guard.

### Core API (`pkg/yaml`)

All operations funnel through a single `evaluate(content, expr)` choke point that
runs yqlib with fixed preferences (2-space indent, no colors, doc separators
preserved, scalars unwrapped on read) and silences yq's internal logger.

| Function | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Get(content, path) (string, error)` | Read a value (missing/null → `ErrYAMLPathNotFound`). |
| `GetTyped[T](content, path) (T, error)` | Read and decode into `T`. |
| `Set(content, path, value) ([]byte, error)` | Assign a string scalar. |
| `SetRaw(content, path, rhs) ([]byte, error)` | Assign a typed/raw yq RHS (`true`, `42`, …). |
| `Delete(content, path) ([]byte, error)` | Remove a node (`del(...)`). |
| `Eval(content, expr) ([]byte, error)` | Raw yq expression escape hatch. |
| `Format(content) ([]byte, error)` | Identity reformat / normalize. |
| `GetFile` / `SetFile` / `SetFileRaw` / `DeleteFile` / `FormatFile` | File wrappers with **atomic write** (temp + rename, mode-preserving). |

### Addressing: dot-notation → yq path

`DotPathToYqPath` translates user-facing dot paths into yq path expressions:

```
vars.region                         -> .vars.region
sources[0].version                  -> .sources[0].version
components.terraform.vpc.vars.cidr  -> .components.terraform.vpc.vars.cidr
metadata."weird.key"                -> .metadata.["weird.key"]
```

Simple identifier keys are emitted bare; keys with dots/symbols use yq's quoted
`.["..."]` form. A path already starting with `.` is treated as a raw yq
expression and passed through unchanged.

### Strict anchor/alias guard

yqlib preserves anchor *topology*, but assigning **through an alias** silently
mutates the shared anchor — e.g. setting `.components.vpc.tags.Team` when
`vpc.tags` is `*commontags` also changes every other location that aliases
`&commontags`. A before/after comparison of the anchor *set* alone misses this,
because the set is unchanged.

`guardAnchors(before, after)` therefore compares, per anchor name:

1. **Existence** — anchor added, removed, renamed, or expanded → reject.
2. **Alias count** — number of aliases referencing it changed (an alias was
   flattened to a literal, or a new one appeared) → reject.
3. **Shared content** — an anchor that is referenced by ≥1 alias had its value
   change → reject (this is the silent-shared-mutation case).

Edits that touch no anchor/alias relationship always pass. Violations return
`ErrYAMLAnchorAltered` with a hint to edit the anchor definition explicitly or
restructure.

### Domain commands (Phase 2)

The three domains never re-implement YAML editing; they only (a) resolve **which
file**, (b) shape the **dot-path** for their schema, (c) optionally validate.

- **Config** — `atmos config get|set|delete <dot-path> [value]`. Auto-resolves
  the active `atmos.yaml` (with `--config` override). Paths are config-relative.
- **Stack** — `atmos stack get|set|delete -s <stack> -c <component> '<dot-path> [= value]'`.
  Uses the existing **provenance** package (`pkg/merge` + `internal/exec`
  merge-context store) to find the *winning* source manifest for a merged value
  (`ProvenanceStorage.GetLatest(path).File`), then edits that file. If the path
  is defined nowhere, an explicit `--file` is required (never guess where to
  create new keys). The edited file is always reported.
- **Vendor** — `atmos vendor get|set` (by component/source name) plus the ported
  `atmos vendor update` / `atmos vendor diff` feature set, with all YAML writes
  routed through `pkg/yaml.SetFile`.

### Optional: `format`

`Format`/`FormatFile` enable a normalize/format capability (e.g. `atmos fmt`
with `--check` for CI and `-w` to write). Surface TBD in Phase 2.

## Errors

Package-local sentinels in `pkg/yaml/errors.go`: `ErrInvalidYAMLExpression`,
`ErrYAMLPathNotFound`, `ErrYAMLUpdateFailed`, `ErrYAMLAnchorAltered`,
`ErrParseYAML`, `ErrReadFile`, `ErrWriteFile`. Domain layers wrap these with
the error builder + hints.

## Preservation guarantees (verified)

Validated empirically and locked in by tests, an edit to one value preserves,
verbatim, everything it did not target:

- **Comments** — head, line/inline, and foot comments (inline-comment spacing is
  normalized to a single space).
- **Anchors & aliases** — anchor definitions, alias references, and YAML merge
  keys (`<<: *anchor`); the strict guard rejects edits that would change shared
  anchor data.
- **Atmos YAML functions** — custom tags such as `!terraform.output`, `!env`,
  `!store`, `!terraform.state` round-trip unchanged.
- **Go/Gomplate templates** — `{{ … }}` expressions in single-quoted,
  double-quoted, literal-block, and unquoted scalars round-trip without delimiter
  mangling, both when adjacent to an edit and when set as a new value.

## Testing

- `pkg/yaml/edit_test.go` — comment preservation across set/delete; nested and
  indexed paths; typed `SetRaw`; `Get`/`GetTyped`; not-found; atomic file write
  with mode preservation; dot-path translation; the three anchor-guard rejection
  cases (edit-through-alias, edit-anchor-def, untouched-anchors-preserved). The
  edit-through-alias rejection was written as a failing test first.
- `pkg/yaml/stability_test.go` — a "kitchen-sink" fixture (block/folded scalars,
  flow collections, quoting styles, unicode, merge keys, sequences of maps) plus
  focused fixtures asserting comments + anchor topology survive set/delete/format
  and that `Format` is idempotent.
- `pkg/yaml/functions_templates_test.go` — asserts Atmos function tags and Go
  templates are preserved verbatim across set/delete/format and round-trip when
  set as values.

## Known limitations

- yqlib normalizes inline-comment spacing to a single space and standardizes
  indentation to the configured value; untouched lines are otherwise preserved.
  This is "preserve as much as possible", not byte-identical round-tripping.
- **Blank lines are not preserved.** The `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` node model (which
  yqlib is built on — and which the superseded branch also used) does not record
  blank lines between mapping entries, so they are collapsed on write. Comments,
  anchors, function tags, and templates are preserved; purely cosmetic blank
  separators are not. This is inherent to the yaml.v3 ecosystem.
- `Get` treats an explicit `null` the same as a missing key
  (`ErrYAMLPathNotFound`).
- Anchor-heavy documents where the user genuinely wants to edit shared data must
  edit the anchor definition explicitly; the strict guard rejects implicit
  shared mutation by design.
