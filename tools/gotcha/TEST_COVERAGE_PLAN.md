# Test Coverage Improvement Plan for Gotcha

## Current Status
- **Date Started**: 2025-09-17
- **Starting Coverage**: 38.4%
- **Target Coverage**: 80-90%
- **Current Coverage**: 38.4% (last updated: 2025-09-17 15:20)

## Important Constraints
‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT CHANGE CORE BEHAVIOR** - The tool is working correctly. Only add tests, do not modify existing functionality.

## Progress Tracker

## Testing Principles
1. **No Behavior Changes**: Tests must pass with existing code
2. **Mock External Dependencies**: Use mocks for GitHub API, filesystem, etc.
3. **Table-Driven Tests**: Use table tests for multiple scenarios
4. **Test Both Paths**: Always test success and error cases
5. **Real Scenarios**: Write tests that reflect actual usage

## Common Test Patterns

### Mock Setup Pattern
```go
func TestFunction(t *testing.T) {
    // Setup
    originalValue := packageVariable
    defer func() { packageVariable = originalValue }()
    
    // Test
    // ...
}
```

### Table-Driven Test Pattern
```go
func TestFunction(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        input   string
        want    string
        wantErr bool
    }{
        {"valid input", "input", "output", false},
        {"invalid input", "", "", true},
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            got, err := Function(tt.input)
            if (err != nil) != tt.wantErr {
                t.Errorf("error = %v, wantErr %v", err, tt.wantErr)
            }
            if got != tt.want {
                t.Errorf("got = %v, want %v", got, tt.want)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

## Next Steps
1. Start with `cmd/gotcha/stream_execution_test.go`
2. Focus on testing existing behavior, not changing it
3. Update this file after each test file is created
4. Run coverage after each file to track progress

## Commands to Run
```bash
# Run tests with coverage
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...

# View coverage report
go tool cover -html=coverage.out

# Check overall coverage
go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep total

# Run specific package tests
go test -v -cover ./cmd/gotcha
go test -v -cover ./pkg/stream
```

## Risk Mitigation
- Run existing tests before and after adding new tests
- Verify no behavior changes with manual testing
- Use `git diff` to ensure only test files are modified
- Create small, focused PRs for each test file
