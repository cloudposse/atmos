// This workspace configuration ensures that:
// 1. Only the current directory's go.mod is used
// 2. tools/gotcha is explicitly NOT included in the workspace
// 3. go mod operations on this directory won't affect gotcha
//
// Note: gotcha is a completely standalone tool with its own module
// at github.com/cloudposse/gotcha and should remain independent
